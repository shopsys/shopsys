# Design Implementation and Customization
Here are the basic technologies we use in Shopsys Framework for design implementation:

- [LESS pre-processor](http://lesscss.org/) for definition of cascading style sheets (i.e. [CSS](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Overview.en.html))
    - the LESS files are located in `src/Resources/styles`  
    - you can read more about LESS in separate article [Introduction to Less](./introduction-to-less.md)
- [Grunt task runner](https://gruntjs.com/) for generation of CSS from LESS
    - `Gruntfile.js` is generated from `templates/Grunt/gruntfile.js.twig` during application build using `gruntfile` by [Phing target](../introduction/console-commands-for-application-management-phing-targets.md)
- [Twig templating engine](https://twig.symfony.com/) for definition of HTML (and other) templates
    - the Twig templates are located in `templates` directory

When you want to customize the styles or templates, you can modify any of the files directly, as all of them are located in your project.

## Multidomain design customization
Shopsys Framework provides an ability of running multiple domains as a single application,
if you want to know more about this concept, you can read [the separate article](../introduction/domain-multidomain-multilanguage.md).
In order to change your multidomain appearance, you can set two parameters [`domains.yml`](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/blob/master/project-base/config/domains.yml) configuration file:

- `styles_directory`
    - allows you to define a custom sub-folder with LESS files in `src/Resources/styles`
    - if you need to use custom styles for a particular domain, put your LESS files in this sub-folder
    - you can create your own directories structure in the sub-folder that suits your needs
- `design_id`
    - allows you to define a design identifier
    - the parameter can be a number (e.g. domain ID), however, you can use a string identifier as well (e.g. "flat-design") so you are able to use the same design across multiple domains
    - if you want to use custom template for a particular domain, duplicate the original one that is used for the first domain and add `.design_id` value as a suffix to its name (e.g. `detail.html.twig` -> `detail.flat-design.html.twig`)
    - all the multi-design templates must be located in the same folders as their originals
        - there is a huge advantage from the usability point of view - when you change a controller, you need to change all the related multi-design templates.
        In such a case, you see all the templates in the same folder and you do not need to seek for them anywhere else
