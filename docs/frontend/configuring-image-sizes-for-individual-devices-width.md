# Configuring Image Sizes for Individual Devices Width
In Shopsys Framework you can configure image sizes for individual devices width. This is allowed by HTML element [Picture element (see more in Mozilla official documentation)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/picture).

## Introduction
This document serves for introducing you with the process of managing images on Shopsys Framework.

!!! tip
    In order to get correct image sizes of additional images then your original image must be larger than highest size in additional image size.

## Configuration file
In order to set right sizes for individual devices width you have to configure `config/images.yaml`.

Let us explain example code in configuration file `images.yaml` of attribute `additionalSizes`. The following code show section `product` with types `gallery` and `main`.
```yml
-   name: product
    class: Shopsys\FrameworkBundle\Model\Product\Product
    types:
        -   name: gallery
            multiple: true
            sizes:
                -   name: detail
                    width: 200
                    height: 300
                    crop: false
                    occurrence: 'Front-end: Product detail, when selected'
                    additionalSizes:
                       - {width: 1100, height: ~, media: "(min-width: 1200px)"}
                       - {width: 275, height: ~, media: "(max-width: 480px)"}
                -   name: list
                    width: 100
                    height: 100
                    crop: true
                    occurrence: 'Front-end: Product detail'
        -   name: main
            sizes:
                -   name: ~
                    width: 200
                    height: 300
                    crop: false
                    occurrence: 'Front-end: Product detail, Product list'
```
For type `gallery` and size `detail` are set two additional sizes. First is image width `1100px` for devices with minimal width `1200px`. Second one is image width `275px` for devices with maximal width `480px`. In other cases there is image with width `200px`.

## How to generate images with modified sizes
In case you modified image sizes in file `images.yaml`, then would be needed to remove yet generated images. You approach that by removing images for modified size name of appropriate section. Folder path would look like `web/content/images/<section-name>/<type-name>`.

!!! warning
    Be aware of not removing folder `original` in path `web/content/images/<section-name>`.

### Example
Assume we want to add new image size for the main image above gallery at the product detail page. We want affect only devices with maximal browser width `480px`. Image size for new device width should be `410px`. You can achieve that by following steps.

#### 1. Add new value for attribute `product.gallery.detail.additionalSizes` in configuration file `images.yaml`.

```diff
    -   name: product
        class: Shopsys\FrameworkBundle\Model\Product\Product
        types:
            -   name: gallery
                multiple: true
                sizes:
                    -   name: detail
                        width: 200
                        height: 300
                        crop: false
                        occurrence: 'Front-end: Product detail, when selected'
+                       additionalSizes:
+                           - {width: 410, height: ~, media: "(max-width: 480px)"}
```

#### 2. Remove all images in `web/content/images/product/default`.
This step is applied only if there already exist some generated images for additional sizes.
