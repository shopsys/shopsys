# Coding standards

## Eslint

- can show you error on demand when you are writing your code - and I have to install editor plugin to use it (can be used on server side in any test)
- rules are defined in files:

```plain
- .eslintignore, .eslintrc.json
```

## Prettier

- can format you code on save or can be fired by key shortcut - and I have to install editor plugin to use it
- rules are defined in file:

```plain
- .prettierrc
```

## Editorconfig

- adds coding standards into your IDE even if you don't have any plugin installed
- rules are defined in file:

```plain
- .editorconfig
```
