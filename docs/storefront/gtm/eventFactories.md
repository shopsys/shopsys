# GTM Event Factories

These factories are responsible for creating and preparing GTM event objects. They can be written either as basic `get` methods, such as `getGtmCartViewEvent`, or as hooks, such as `useGtmStaticPageViewEvent`. The difference between them is

## getGtmCartViewEvent

```ts
export const getGtmCartViewEvent = (
    currencyCode: string; // the code of the currency used on the domain
    valueWithoutVat: number, // the value of the cart without VAT
    valueWithVat: number, // the value of the cart with VAT
    products: GtmCartItemType[] | undefined, // products in cart, if available
): GtmCartViewEventType => {
    // function body not included in this code block
}
```

## getGtmContactInformationPageViewEvent

```ts
export const getGtmContactInformationPageViewEvent = (
  gtmCartInfo: GtmCartInfoType // the cart of the current user in the shape of GTM cart information
): GtmContactInformationPageViewEventType => {
  // function body not included in this code block
};
```

## getGtmPaymentAndTransportPageViewEvent

```ts
export const getGtmPaymentAndTransportPageViewEvent = (
