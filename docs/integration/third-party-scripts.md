# Third party scripts

You may want to include some other scripts like data analytics in your page.
We recommend using [GTM (Google Tag Manager)](https://developers.google.com/tag-platform/tag-manager) for this purpose.
GTM is already implemented in storefront and includes important information about user actions like product id on product detail page,
total price of order in the cart, and more.
