# Social networks

Social network use PHP backend library [Hybridauth](https://hybridauth.github.io/)

## How to set it up?

You can set up which social network logins are enabled on which domain in `social_network_config.yaml` file.

For every social network, you need `app_id` and `app_secret`. Below you have information on where and how to get them. The credentials then need to be set to the corresponding environment variables.

Every social network require URL for backward redirect to the eshop.
In Shopsys Platform, you have to add URL `{eshop_domain}/social-network/login/{type}` where `{eshop_domain}` is your domain and `{type}` is the social network name, e.g.: `google`, `facebook`, `seznam`, etc.
For local development, social networks usually require https.

### Facebook

-   create [application](https://developers.facebook.com/apps)
-   in that application, in `App settings` â†’ `Basic` you will find `app_id` and `app_secret`

P.S.: If you are owner of the Facebook application, and you log in with this owner account, email will not come after login, more info: https://github.com/hybridauth/hybridauth/issues/1372#issuecomment-1542447803

### Google

-   log into Google account and create [OAuth 2.0 Client IDs](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials)
    -   first, you need to create a project,
    -   then you have to need to click on "+ create credentials" and select "OAuth client ID",
    -   then, click on "configure consent screen" and fill in the required fields (choose an "internal" user type).
    -   After you configure the consent screen, once again click on "+ create credentials" and select "OAuth client ID".
    -   As an application type, choose "web application" and fill in the required fields.
    -   You need to add an authorized redirect URI here, which is `{eshop_domain}/social-network/login/google`

## How to add next social network

Only what you have to do is add configuration to file `social_network_config.yaml` and add a new value to `LoginTypeEnumDecorator.types.yaml`.
The provider key (i.e. the name of the social network) in the `social_network_config.yaml` file must be the same as the key in `LoginTypeEnum`.
It should be enough to get inspired by Facebook or Google configs.
