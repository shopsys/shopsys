# Installation Using Docker for MacOS

**This guide is for the version which is not released yet. See the [version for `v7.1.0`](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/blob/v7.1.0/docs/installation/installation-using-docker-macos.md).**

This guide covers building new projects based on Shopsys Framework.
If you want to contribute to the framework itself,
you need to install the whole [shopsys/shopsys](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys) monorepo.
Take a look at the article about [Monorepo](../introduction/monorepo.md) for more information.

This solution uses [*docker-sync*](http://docker-sync.io/) (for fast two-way synchronization of the application files between the host machine and Docker volume).

## Requirements
* [GIT](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
* [PHP](http://php.net/manual/en/install.macosx.php)
    * At least version **7.1 or higher**
* [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-linux-unix-osx)
* [Docker for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/)
    * Docker-sync suggests ([in known issue](https://github.com/EugenMayer/docker-sync/issues/517)) to use Docker for Mac in version 17.09.1-ce-mac42 (21090)
    * Docker for Mac requires at least 4 GB of memory, otherwise, `composer install` can result in `Killed` status (we recommend to set 2 GB RAM, 1 CPU and 2 GB Swap in `Docker -> Preferencesâ€¦ -> Advanced`)
    * Version of Docker Engine should be at least **17.05 or higher** so it supports [multi-stage builds](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/multistage-build/).
    * Version of Docker Compose should be at least **1.17.0 or higher** because we use compose file version `3.4`
* [Docker-sync](http://docker-sync.io/) (install via `sudo gem install docker-sync`)

## Steps
### 1. Create new project from Shopsys Framework sources
```
composer create-project shopsys/project-base --no-install --keep-vcs
cd project-base
```

*Notes:*
- *The `--no-install` option disables installation of the vendors - this will be done later in the Docker container.*
- *The `--keep-vcs` option initializes GIT repository in your project folder that is needed for diff commands of the application build and keeps the GIT history of `shopsys/project-base`.*

### 1.1 Use install script
In case you want to start demo of the app as fast as possible, you can now execute install script.

```
./scripts/install.sh
```

If you want to know more about what is happening during installation, continue with next step.

### 1.2 Enable second domain (optional)
There are two domains each for different language in default installation. First one is available via IP adress `127.0.O.1` and second one via `127.0.0.2`.
`127.0.0.2` is not alias of `127.0.0.1` on Mac by default. To create this alias in network interface run:
```
sudo ifconfig lo0 alias 127.0.0.2 up
```

### 2. Create docker-compose.yml and docker-sync.yml
Create `docker-compose.yml` from template [`docker-compose-mac.yml.dist`](../../project-base/docker/conf/docker-compose-mac.yml.dist).
```
cp docker/conf/docker-compose-mac.yml.dist docker-compose.yml
```

Create `docker-sync.yml` from template [`docker-sync.yml.dist`](../../project-base/docker/conf/docker-sync.yml.dist).
```
cp docker/conf/docker-sync.yml.dist docker-sync.yml
```

#### Set the UID and GID to allow file access in mounted volumes
Because we want both the user in host machine (you) and the user running php-fpm in the container to access shared files, we need to make sure that they both have the same UID and GID.
This can be achieved by build arguments `www_data_uid` and `www_data_gid` that should be set to the same UID and GID as your own user in your `docker-compose.yml`.
Also, you need to change `sync_userid` in `docker-sync.yml` file.

You can find out your UID by running `id -u` and your GID by running `id -g`.

Once you get these values, set these values into your `docker-compose.yml` into `php-fpm` container definition by replacing values in `args` section.

Also you need to insert your UID into `docker-sync.yml` into value `sync_userid`.

### 3. Compose Docker container
On MacOS you need to synchronize folders using docker-sync.
Before starting synchronization you need to create a directory for persisting Postgres and Elasticsearch data so you won't lose it when the container is shut down.
```
mkdir -p var/postgres-data var/elasticsearch-data vendor
docker-sync start
```

Then rebuild and start containers
```
docker-compose up -d --build
```

***Note:** During the build of the docker containers there will be installed 3-rd party software as dependencies of Shopsys Framework by [Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/) with licenses that are described in document [Open Source License Acknowledgements and Third-Party Copyrights](../../open-source-license-acknowledgements-and-third-party-copyrights.md)*

### 4. Setup the application
