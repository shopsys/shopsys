# Using Form Types
In this article we will show what types you can use when creating or editing forms, what options they have and what they do.

We use two types of naming for form types:

- `*FormType` - This type is used in Controllers to create forms and their views on front-end or they are used in other FormTypes as sub-forms
- `*Type` - This type is used only in other FormTypes to ease adding fields with their own widgets and to add to their reusability

## Default options
Every form type has some default options that can be used for various things.

### macro
Defaults to `null`.  
This option is used as array with two options (`name`, `recommended_length`) and its currently used for working with SEO:

- `name` - this option has two values that can be used
    - `seoFormRowMacros` - this value shows single domain `TextType` field with information about current length and recommended length
    - `seoFormRowMacros.multidomainRow` - this value shows multidomain `TextType` field with information about current length and recommended length
- `recommended_length` - it's an integer value that is used to show recommended maximal length of a text

### icon_title
Defaults to `null`.  
This option is used to add information icon after form field that shows tooltip with message after hovering.
To show message you need to fill this option with string that you want to show in the tooltip.

### display_format
Defaults to `null`.  
You can use this option if you want to have no padding in your rendered form_row.
To achieve this you need to fill this option with constant `FormRenderingConfigurationExtension::DISPLAY_FORMAT_MULTIDOMAIN_ROWS_NO_PADDING`

### js_container
Defaults to `null`.  
This option is used as array with two options (`container_class`, `data_type`) and can be used to wrap your form_row in `<div class="{{ js_container.container_class }}" data-type="{{ js_container.data_type }}">`

### render_form_row
Defaults to `true`.  
If you want to add your FormType and don't render its `form_label` and `form_errors` you can set this option to false.
This can be set to create FormTypes that can be used in other FormTypes like the ones that are listed below.

## Form types
