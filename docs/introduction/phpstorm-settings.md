# PHPStorm Settings

If you are using PHPStorm, we have prepared the code scheme for you to work easily with Shopsys Platform and its Frontend API.

## Importing the scheme in PHPStorm

_Note: This guide will import new scheme in your PHPStorm, your previous schemes and other PHPStorm settings will not be changed._

-   To configure your IDE, select `PhpStorm -> Preferences` for macOS or `File -> Settings` for Windows and Linux.
-   From menu select `Editor -> Code Style`
-   Right of `Scheme` select box is cogwheel, click it and select `Import Scheme...`
-   Import file `app/config/phpstorm/phpstorm.xml`
-   Now you will see the new scheme in Scheme select box
-   Make sure that you have selected this scheme for PHP, JavaScript, and Typescript

_Note: In some cases it is necessary to invalidate cache (`File -> Invalidate Caches ...`) and restart PHPStorm for changes to take effect._
