# Development Workflow of Project on Shopsys Platform

## Requirements
* Shopsys Platform [installed](../installation/installation-guide.md)
* [GIT repository](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository) created from Shopsys Platform [project-base](https://github.com/shopsys/project-base/)

## How to develop a new feature
1. Create a new branch from `master` branch e.g., `my-new-feature`

1. Develop your feature

1. Check and automatically fix your code standards using `php phing standards-fix-diff`

    !!! hint
        In this step you were using Phing target `standards-fix-diff`.  
        More information about what Phing targets are and how they work can be found in [Console Commands for Application Management (Phing Targets)](../introduction/console-commands-for-application-management-phing-targets.md)

1. Check if all tests are passing using `php phing tests`

1. Run acceptance tests `php phing tests-acceptance`

    !!! tip
        We suggest you running acceptance tests on your Continuous Integration server because it takes several minutes to run them.

1. [Create commit](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit) with descriptive commit message about changes you have made.

    !!! tip
        We have [Guidelines for Creating Commits](../contributing/guidelines-for-creating-commits.md) for contributors to Shopsys Platform.
        These guidelines suggest some best practices for creating commits that you could adopt on your project.

1. [Push changes](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-push) to your remote GIT repository

1. Let some colleague review your code and fix all reported problems

    !!! note
        We pay a lot of attention to code quality in Shopsys company.
        Apart from automatic testing and coding standards checks at least one of the colleagues reviews your code and another colleague tests changes whether they are working properly.
        We found this practices very important and we suggest them to you as part of your development process.

1. [Rebase](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-rebase) your branch on the current version of `master` branch

    !!! note
        This leads to [clean GIT history](https://blog.shopsys.com/keep-your-git-history-clean-with-minimum-effort-4b86b5619b1).

1. [Merge](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-merge) your branch (e.g., `my-new-feature`) into `master` branch.

1. Push `master` branch
