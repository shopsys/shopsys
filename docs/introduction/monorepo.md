# Monorepo

This document provides basic information about development in monorepo to make the work with packages and project-base repository as easy as possible.

If you want to contribute to Shopsys Framework or to any of its packages,
clone this monorepo [shopsys/shopsys](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys).

If you want to build your project on Shopsys Framework,
use composer to create project from [shopsys/project-base](https://github.com/shopsys/project-base).

## Problem
Due to the growing number of new repositories, there were many situations when a developer had to reflect the same change
into more than one package. It meant, that the developer had to implement this in the separated repositories of each package.
This approach was inefficient and repeated process always brought increased errors rate.

## Solution
Monorepo approach provides a single development environment for management of all parts of Shopsys Framework.
We use [Monorepo tool](https://github.com/shopsys/monorepo-tools) that splits code in appropriate repositories
after some changes are made in monorepo. This splitting is initiated automatically once a day.

If you are interested, you can read more about the monorepo approach here - https://gomonorepo.org

*Note: The list of these packages is maintained in the function `get_all_packages` in [`.ci/monorepo_functions.sh`](/.ci/monorepo_functions.sh).
It is used for automated splitting of the monorepo and needs to be updated when a package is added or removed.*

## Infrastructure
Monorepo can be installed and used as standard application. This requires some additional infrastructure:

* **docker/** - templates for configuration of docker in monorepo.

* **build.xml** - definitions of targets for use in the monorepo, some already defined targets
have modified behavior in such a way that their actions are launched over all monorepo packages

* **composer.json** - contains the dependencies required by individual packages and by Shopsys Framework.
It is not generated automatically, so each change made in the `composer.json` of the specific package must be reflected
also in `composer.json` in the root of monorepo. In monorepo, Shopsys packages are used directly from the directory
`packages/`, so there are no requirements of those packages in `composer.json`.

* **parameters_monorepo.yml** - overriding of global variables of Shopsys Framework, which makes it possible to run
Shopsys Framework in monorepo

## Installation of monorepo
Installation of Shopsys Framework is almost the same as is described in [Installation Using Docker](/docs/installation/installation-guide.md#installation-using-docker),
but instead of creating a new project based on `project-base` repository, you have to clone [`shopsys/shopsys`](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys).

Please keep in mind that all commands have to be executed from the monorepo root directory.
Also templates of a configuration files should be copied from `docker/` folder in root, not from `project-base` folder.

## Development in monorepo
During the development in monorepo, it is necessary to ensure that the changes made in specific package
preserve the functionality of the package even outside the monorepo.

Keep in mind that the file structure of project based on Shopsys Framework (standardly located in the root of the project) is in monorepo
located in the directory `project-base/`.

## Troubleshooting
* Package is functional in monorepo but broken outside of monorepo - ensure that every parameter required by package
is available even outside the monorepo
