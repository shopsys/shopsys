# Pagination
Shopsys Framework Frontend API uses pagination inspired by [Relay cursor connection](https://facebook.github.io/relay/graphql/connections.htm)

Every paginated entity uses connection with information about current page and paginated entities.
For more information please see [the specification](https://facebook.github.io/relay/graphql/connections.htm)

## Usage

If you want to get eg. paginated products you can use `products` query.

```text
{
  products{}
}
```

This query will return a `connection` object which consists of `pageInfo`, `edges` and `totalCount`.

`pageInfo` is object that represents information about current page of pagination that you are on.  
`edges` are array of objects that are generated and represent the products that you get.  
`totalCount` is total number of products available for query.
`edge` need to consist of `cursor` (pointer to products location) and `node` (data of given product that you requested).  
When you define connection you need to specify what should be the type of `node` (eg. `Product` or `String`)

To get your products you need to simply write query that gets you the data that you need from the `node` field of `edge` with `first` or `last` parameters:

```text
{
  products (first:10) {
    edges {
      cursor
      node {
        name
        link
        shortDescription
      }
    }
  }
}

// OR

{
  products (last:10) {
    edges {
      cursor
      node {
        name
        link
        shortDescription
      }
    }
  }
}
```

To get next page you simply need to add the `after` parameter if you are using `first` or `before` of you are using `last` with cursor of a node

```text
{
  products (first:10, after: "YXJyYXljb25uZWN0aW9uOjk=") {
    edges {
      cursor
      node {
        name
        link
        shortDescription
      }
    }
  }
}

// OR

{
  products (last:10, before: "YXJyYXljb25uZWN0aW9uOjEw") {
    edges {
      cursor
      node {
        name
        link
        shortDescription
      }
    }
  }
}
```

To order your result add the `orderingMode` parameter, which is GraphQL enum type `ProductOrderingModeEnum`. You are not able to use other value than supported values of the specified type.
If you want to add more ordering modes, feel free to extend the type in `ProductOrderingModeEnum.types.yaml`.
```text
{
  products (orderingMode: NAME_ASC) {
    edges {
      cursor
      node {
        name
        link
        shortDescription
      }
    }
  }
}
```
