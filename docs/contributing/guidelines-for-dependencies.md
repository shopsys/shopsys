# Guidelines for Dependencies

We care about `composer.json` unity across all repositories and we try to avoid hidden dependencies.
So we created a few rules we follow.

## External dependencies

We use asterisk `*` notation for PHP extensions.

We use caret `^` notation for external dependencies and if there are more major versions possible, we use single pipe `|` notation without spaces.
For example `^6.2.0`, `^7.0`, `^5.0|^6.0|^7.0.4`.

If there is a problem, you can stabilize the dependency in a patch version, for example `6.4.2`.
Please do it in a separate commit with an explanation in the commit message.

## Working with dependencies

After you change a dependency in a package or project-base, you have to reflect the change in the `composer.json` of a given package obviously.

Packages' `composer.json` are not used automatically during development in monorepo.
Monorepo uses root `composer.json` that have to contain all dependencies of all packages.
Monorepo dependencies are managed manually.
If you add or change any dependency in package or project-base, reapply the change into monorepo `composer.json`.

## How to deal with Shopsys dependencies

If the package or project-base depends on a shopsys package, we declare `dev-master` dependency.
During the release, we change `dev-master` dependency to released tag like `v7.0.0-alpha1`.

## Exceptions

* `shopsys/coding-standards` is required in `^3.x.x` version because current development version is still too unstable
* We use `doctrine/orm` branch `dev-doctrine-260-with-ddc1960-hotfix-and-ddc4005-hotfix` because it contain fixes for
[#DDC-1960](https://github.com/doctrine/doctrine2/issues/2633)
and [#DCC-4005](https://github.com/doctrine/doctrine2/issues/4869)
and until these fixes are in the doctrine tagged version, we have to rely on this branch
* We still rely on a couple of packages that are not tagged yet, so we use `dev-master`, `dev-branch` or `dev-master#hash` version
* We declare `@dev` stability for a couple of packages.
When our package depends on `shopsys/framework`, we have to tell the composer it can use the `dev-*` transitive dependency.
This notation cannot be used for the `doctrine/orm` inline require alias unfortunately

!!! note
    During composer installation there will be installed 3-rd party software as dependencies of Shopsys Framework with licenses that are described in document [Open Source License Acknowledgements and Third-Party Copyrights](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/blob/master/open-source-license-acknowledgements-and-third-party-copyrights.md)
