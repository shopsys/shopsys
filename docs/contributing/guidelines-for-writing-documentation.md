# Guidelines for Writing Documentation

* Documentation is distributed with the source code of Shopsys Framework inside [docs](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/tree/master/docs/) directory in the project root.
* Documentation is written in [Markdown format](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).
* All documentation files should be named same as first heading (in lowercase, non-alphanumeric characters replaced by dash).
* References to project files and classes have to be absolute links to the GitHub in proper version - eg. `[app/config/config.yml](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/blob/master/project-base/app/config/config.yml)`.
* All words in a title except conjunctions (and, or, but...), articles (a, an, the), and short prepositions (in, to, of...) should be capitalized. Other headings should not be capitalized.
