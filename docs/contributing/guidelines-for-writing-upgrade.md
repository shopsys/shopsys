# Guidelines for writing UPGRADE.md

Keep in mind that upgrade instructions are written for users that do not understand our system well, so more clear they are, more useful they are.

## Introduction

* Our users work in a clone of project-base and even when they do the upgrade, their project-base is not upgraded.
  Every time you change/add anything in project-base, write upgrade instruction how to repeat this work
    * for anything with docker, phing, frontend, config, ...
* Make instructions as easy to follow as possible
    * Good example: [postgres upgrade](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/blob/master/UPGRADE.md#postgresql-upgrade)
    * Copyable commands are great
    * Bad example: *"Apply changes done in PR..."*, however link to particular diff is all right
* If you mention a file, make a link for it
    * This is especially important for files in project-base, as users don't have new changes in their project-base
* Link files in an accurate version, because the project evolves in time
    * Good example: [installation using docker - version alpha5](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/blob/v7.0.0-alpha5/docs/installation/installation-using-docker-application-setup.md)
    * Bad example: [installation using docker - master](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/blob/master/docs/installation/installation-using-docker-application-setup.md)
* Write instructions
    * Good example: *"Do this, then that"*
    * Bad example: *"This was done, this was changed"*

## Files related to upgrade

The main file where a project developer should start looking for instructions is [`UPGRADE.md`](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/blob/master/UPGRADE.md) file in the monorepo root.

This file contains information for the contributors in the form of the link to [`upgrade/upgrading-monorepo.md`](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/blob/master/upgrade/upgrading-monorepo.md) file.

Instructions for developers building a project based on project-base should follow.
First, there must be general information about upgrading with recommended steps and a typical upgrade sequence,
following with a list of links to upgrade guides for each version.
These versions should be placed in a [`upgrade/`](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/tree/master/upgrade/) folder.

## Structure of upgrade files

Each upgrade file must have link to main UPGRADE.md file with general information about upgrade and may contain one or more of following main sections:

* shopsys/framework
* shopsys/coding-standards
* shopsys/form-types-bundle
* shopsys/http-smoke-testing
* shopsys/migrations
* shopsys/monorepo-tools
* shopsys/plugin-interface
* shopsys/product-feed-google
* shopsys/product-feed-heureka
* shopsys/product-feed-heureka-delivery
* shopsys/product-feed-zbozi

Each section must contain instructions relevant only to the package they cover and the sections have to be ordered as they are in a list above.

Each step should have a link to the related pull request and may contain an additional link or links to make instruction more clear.

### Section shopsys/framework

Because this section is expected to be the longest, it should contain a finer division into one or more of the following sub-sections:

* Infrastructure
    * related with Docker, Kubernetes, Environment settings, ...
    * instruction to rebuild images must occur only once
* Composer dependencies
    * related to composer.json
* Configuration
    * related with parameters, YML configuration files, ...
* Tools
    * Phing, PHPStan, PHPUnit, ...
* Database migrations
    * Which database changes were introduced in a current version
* Security
    * Important security upgrades
* Application
    * Changes in a code that may require some changes in a particular implementation.
