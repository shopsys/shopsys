## [From 7.0.0-alpha5 to Unreleased]
### [shopsys/project-base]
- [Microservice Product Search Export](https://github.com/shopsys/microservice-product-search-export) was added and it needs to be installed and run
    - check changes in the `docker-compose.yml` template you used and replicate them, there is a new container `microservice-product-search-export`
    - `parameters.yml.dist` contains new parameter `microservice_product_search_export_url` which need to be filled in your `parameters.yml` (executing `composer install` should be enough)
- instead of building the Docker images of the microservices yourself, you can use pre-built images on Docker Hub (see the `docker-compose.yml` template you used)
- [#438 - Attribute telephone moved from a billing address to the personal data of a user](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/438)
    - edit `ShopBundle/Form/Front/Customer/BillingAddressFormType` - remove `telephone`
    - edit `ShopBundle/Form/Front/Customer/UserFormType` - add `telephone`
    - edit twig templates and tests in such a way as to reflect the movement of `telephone` attribute according to the [pull request](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/438)
- to use custom postgres configuration check changes in the `docker-compose.yml` templates and replicate them, there is a new volume for `postgres` container
    - PR [Improve Postgres configuration to improve performance](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/444)
    - Stop running containers `docker-compose down`
    - Move data from `project-base/var/postgres-data` into `project-base/var/postgres-data/pgdata`. The directory must have correct permission depending on your OS.
      To provide you with a better image of what exactly needs to be done, there are instructions for Ubuntu:
        - `sudo su`
        - `cd project-base/var/postgres-data/`
        - trick to create directory `pgdata` with correct permissions
            - `cp -rp base/ pgdata`
            - `rm -fr pgdata/*`
        - `shopt -s extglob dotglob`
        - `mv !(pgdata) pgdata`
        - `shopt -u dotglob`
        - `exit`
    - Start containers `docker-compose up -d`
- configuration files (`config.yml`, `config_dev.yml`, `config_test.yml`, `security.yml` and `wysiwyg.yml`) has been split into packages config files (see `app/config/packages` folder)
    - update appropriate package configs in case you had some custom configuration set in those files

### [shopsys/framework]
- check for usages of `TransportEditFormType` - it was removed and all it's attributes were moved to `TransportFormType` so use this form instead
- check for usages of `PaymentEditFormType` - it was removed and all it's attributes were moved to `PaymentFormType` so use this form instead
- check for usages of `ProductEditFormType` - it was removed and all it's attributes were moved to `ProductFormType` so use this form instead
- pay attention to javascripts bound to your forms as well as the elements' names and ids has changed (e.g. from `#product_edit_form_productData` to `#product_form`)
- PHP-FPM and microservice containers now expect a GitHub OAuth token set via a build argument, so it is not necessary to provide it every time those containers are rebuilt
    - see the `github_oauth_token` argument setting in the `docker-compose.yml` template you used and replicate it
    - replace the `place-your-token-here` string by the token generated on [Github -> Settings -> Developer Settings -> Personal access tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?scopes=repo&description=Composer+API+token)
- as there were changes in the Dockerfiles, rebuilding images  is needed (`docker-compose up -d --build`)
- [#438 - Attribute telephone moved from a billing address to the personal data of a user](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/438)
    - this change can affect your extended forms and entities, reflect this change into your project

### [shopsys/shopsys]
- when upgrading your installed [monorepo](docs/introduction/monorepo.md), you'll have to change the build context for the images of the microservices in `docker-compose.yml`
    - `build.context` should be the root of the microservice (eg. `microservices/product-search-export`)
    - `build.dockerfile` should be `docker/Dockerfile`
    - execute `docker-compose up -d --build`, microservices should be up and running

## [From 7.0.0-alpha4 to 7.0.0-alpha5]

### [shopsys/framework]
- for [product search via Elasticsearch](/docs/introduction/product-search-via-elasticsearch.md), you'll have to:
    - check changes in the `docker-compose.yml` template you used and replicate them, there is a new container with Elasticsearch
    - run `docker-compose up -d`
    - update composer dependencies `composer update`
    - create Elasticsearch indexes by running `php phing elasticsearch-indexes-create`
    - export products into Elasticsearch by `php phing elasticsearch-products-export`
- since the fully installed and ready [Microservice Product Search](https://github.com/shopsys/microservice-product-search) is a necessary condition for the Shopsys Framework to run, the installation procedure of this microservice is a part of Shopsys Framework [installation guide](/docs/installation/installation-using-docker-application-setup.md)
 
#### PostgreSQL upgrade:
We decided to move onto a newer version of PostgreSQL.

These steps are for migrating your data onto newer version of postgres and are inspired by [official documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/upgrading.html):

If you are running your project natively then just follow [official instructions](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/upgrading.html), 
if you are using docker infrastructure you can follow steps written below.

1. create a backup of your database by executing::

    `docker exec -it shopsys-framework-postgres pg_dumpall > backupfile`

1. copy new version of `docker-compose.`:

    `cp docker/conf/docker-compose.yml.dist -f docker-compose.yml`

    *Note: select correct `docker-compose` according to your operating system*

1. update version of `database_server_version` from *9.5* to *10.5* in your `parameters.yml`

1. stop containers and delete old data:

    `docker-compose down`

    `rm -rf <project-root-path>/var/postgres-data/*`

1. start new docker-compose stack with newer version of postgres by just recreating your containers:

    `docker-compose up -d --force-recreate`

1. copy backup into postgres container root folder

    `docker cp backupfile shopsys-framework-postgres:/`

1. restore you data:

    `docker exec -it shopsys-framework-postgres psql -d postgres -f backupfile`

1. delete backup file:

    `docker exec -it shopsys-framework-postgres rm backupfile`

### [shopsys/project-base] 
- added [Microservice Product Search](https://github.com/shopsys/microservice-product-search)
    - check changes in the `docker-compose.yml` template you used and replicate them, there is a new container `microservice-product-search`
    - `parameters.yml.dist` contains new parameter `microservice_product_search_url`
    - modify a configuration in `services.yml` for:
        - `Shopsys\FrameworkBundle\Model\Product\Search\ProductSearchRepository`
        - `shopsys.microservice_client.product_search`
    - remove a configuration in `services.yml` for:
        - `Shopsys\FrameworkBundle\Model\Product\Search\ElasticsearchSearchClient`
        - `Shopsys\FrameworkBundle\Model\Product\Search\CachedSearchClient`
        - `Shopsys\FrameworkBundle\Model\Product\Search\SearchClient`
- standardize indentation in your yaml files
    - you can find yaml files with wrong indentation with regexp `^( {4})* {1,3}[^ ]`
        
## [From 7.0.0-alpha3 to 7.0.0-alpha4]

### [shopsys/framework]
- move creation of data objects into factories
- already existing data object factories changed their signatures
- to change the last item in admin breadcrumb, use `BreadcrumbOverrider:overrideLastItem(string $label)` instead of `Breadcrumb::overrideLastItem(MenuItem $item)`
- if you've customized the admin menu by using your own `admin_menu.yml`, implement event listeners instead
    - see the [Adding a New Administration Page](/docs/cookbook/adding-a-new-administration-page.md) cookbook for details

### [shopsys/product-feed-google]
- move creation of data objects into factories
- already existing data object factories changed their signatures

### [shopsys/product-feed-heureka]
- move creation of data objects into factories
- already existing data object factories changed their signatures

### [shopsys/product-feed-zbozi]
- move creation of data objects into factories
- already existing data object factories changed their signatures

## [From 7.0.0-alpha2 to 7.0.0-alpha3]

### [shopsys/framework]
- classes in src/Components were revised, refactored and some of them were moved to model,
    for upgrading to newer version, you must go through commits done in [#272](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/272) and reflect the changes of namespaces.
- FriendlyUrlToGenerateRepository: deleted. If you want to define your own data for friendly url generation, do it so by
    implementing the FriendlyUrlDataProviderInterface and tag your service with `shopsys.friendly_url_provider`.
- check changes in src/Model, all *editData*.php were merged into its *Data*.php relatives
- Twig has been updated to version 2.4.8
    - https://symfony.com/blog/twig-how-to-upgrade-to-2-0-deprecation-notices-to-the-rescue
- access multi-domain attributes of entities via their main entity (instead of the usual entity detail)
    - entity domains (eg. `BrandDomain`) should be created, edited and directly accessed only in their main entities (eg. `Brand`) 
    - see [#165 Different approach to multidomain entities](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/165) for details
- `DomainsType` now uses array of booleans indexed by domain IDs instead of array of domain IDs, original behavior can be restored by adding model data transformer `IndexedBooleansToArrayOfIndexesTransformer`
- `CategoryDomain::$hidden` was changed to `CategoryDomain::$enabled` along with related methods (with negated value)
- `PaymentDomain` and `TransportDomain` are now created even for domains on which the entity should not be visible, check your custom queries that work with payments or transports
- instead of using `EntityManagerFacade::clear()` call `clear()` directly on the `EntityManager`
- all *Detail classes were removed:
    - use `CategoryWithLazyLoadedVisibleChildren` instead of `LazyLoadedCategoryDetail`
    - use `CategoryWithLazyLoadedVisibleChildrenFactory::createCategoriesWithLazyLoadedVisibleChildren()` instead of `CategoryDetailFactory::createLazyLoadedDetails()`
    - use `CategoryFacade::getCategoriesWithLazyLoadedVisibleChildrenForParent()` instead of `CategoryFacade::getVisibleLazyLoadedCategoryDetailsForParent()`
    - use `CategoryWithPreloadedChildren` instead of `CategoryDetail`
    - use `CategoryWithPreloadedChildrenFactory::createCategoriesWithPreloadedChildren()` instead of `CategoryDetailFactory::createDetailsHierarchy()`
    - use `CategoryFacade::getVisibleCategoriesWithPreloadedChildrenForDomain()` instead of `CategoryFacade::getVisibleCategoryDetailsForDomain()`
    - use `PaymentFacade::getIndependentBasePricesIndexedByCurrencyId()` instead of `PaymentDetail::$basePricesByCurrencyId`
    - use `TransportFacade::getIndependentBasePricesIndexedByCurrencyId()` instead of `TransportDetail::$basePricesByCurrencyId`
    - `ProductDetail::hasContentForDetailBox()` is not available anymore (it was useless)
    - use `ProductCachedAttributesFacade` for accessing product parameter values and selling price
    - in templates, use Twig function `getProductParameterValues(product)` instead of `productDetail.parameters`
    - in templates, use Twig function `getProductSellingPrice(product)` instead of `productDetail.sellingPrice`

### [shopsys/project-base]
- Twig has been updated to version 2.4.8
    - https://symfony.com/blog/twig-how-to-upgrade-to-2-0-deprecation-notices-to-the-rescue

### [shopsys/coding-standards]
- create your custom `easy-coding-standard.yml` in your project root with your ruleset (you can use predefined ruleset as shown below) 
- in order to run all checks, there is new unified way - execute `php vendor/bin/ecs check /path/to/project`
- see [EasyCodingStandard docs](https://github.com/Symplify/EasyCodingStandard#usage) for more information
#### Example of custom configuration file
```yaml
#easy-coding-standard.yml
imports:
    - { resource: '%vendor_dir%/shopsys/coding-standards/easy-coding-standard.yml' }
parameters:
    exclude_files:
        - '*/ignored_folder/*'
    skip:
        ObjectCalisthenics\Sniffs\Files\FunctionLengthSniff:
            - '*/src/file.php'
```

### [shopsys/product-feed-google]
- Twig has been updated to version 2.4.8
    - https://symfony.com/blog/twig-how-to-upgrade-to-2-0-deprecation-notices-to-the-rescue
    
### [shopsys/product-feed-heureka]
- Twig has been updated to version 2.4.8
    - https://symfony.com/blog/twig-how-to-upgrade-to-2-0-deprecation-notices-to-the-rescue
    
### [shopsys/product-feed-heureka-delivery]
- Twig has been updated to version 2.4.8
    - https://symfony.com/blog/twig-how-to-upgrade-to-2-0-deprecation-notices-to-the-rescue
    
### [shopsys/product-feed-zbozi]
- Twig has been updated to version 2.4.8
    - https://symfony.com/blog/twig-how-to-upgrade-to-2-0-deprecation-notices-to-the-rescue

## [From 7.0.0-alpha1 to 7.0.0-alpha2]
### [shopsys/project-base]   
- check changes in the `docker-compose.yml` template you used, there were a couple of important changes you need to replicate 
    - easiest way is to overwrite your `docker-compose.yml` with by the appropriate template 
- on *nix systems, fill your UID and GID (you can run `id -u` and `id -g` to obtain them) into Docker build arguments `www_data_uid` and `www_data_gid` and rebuild your image via `docker-compose up --build` 
- change owner of the files in shared volume to `www-data` from the container by running `docker exec -u root shopsys-framework-php-fpm chown -R www-data /var/www/html` 
    - the user has shared UID, so you will be able to access it as well from the host machine 
    - shared volume with postgres data should be owned by `postgres` user: `docker exec -u root shopsys-framework-php-fpm chown -R postgres /var/www/html/var/postgres-data` 
- if you were using a mounted volume to share Composer cache with the container, change the target directory from `/root/.composer` to `/home/www-data/.composer` 
    - in such case, you should change the owner as well by running `docker exec -u root shopsys-framework-php-fpm chown -R www-data /home/www-data/.composer` 

## Before monorepo 
Before we managed to implement monorepo for our packages, we had slightly different versions for each of our package, 
that's why is this section formatted differently.  

### [shopsys/product-feed-heureka]
#### From 0.4.2 to 0.5.0
- requires possibility of extending the CRUD of categories via `shopsys.crud_extension` of type `category`
- requires update of [shopsys/plugin-interface](https://github.com/shopsys/plugin-interface) to version `^0.3.0`
and [shopsys/product-feed-interface](https://github.com/shopsys/product-feed-interface) to `^0.5.0`

- See [Upgrading of shopsys/product-feed-interface](https://github.com/shopsys/product-feed-interface/blob/master/UPGRADE.md#from-010-to-020)

### [shopsys/product-feed-heureka-delivery]
#### From 0.2.0 to 0.2.1
- See [Upgrading of shopsys/product-feed-interface](https://github.com/shopsys/product-feed-interface/blob/master/UPGRADE.md#from-030-to-040)

#### From 0.1.1 to 0.2.0
- See [Upgrading of shopsys/product-feed-interface](https://github.com/shopsys/product-feed-interface/blob/master/UPGRADE.md#from-010-to-030)

### [shopsys/product-feed-interface]
#### From 0.4.0 to 0.5.0
- implement method `getMainCategoryId()` in your implementations of `StandardFeedItemInterface`.

#### From 0.3.0 to 0.4.0
- implement method `isSellingDenied()` for all implementations of `StandardFeedItemInterface`.
- you have to take care of filtering of non-sellable items in implementations of `FeedConfigInterface::processItems()` 
in your product feed plugin because the instances of `StandardFeedItemInterface` passed as an argument can be non-sellable now.
- implement method `getAdditionalInformation()` in your implementations of `FeedConfigInterface`.
- implement method `getCurrencyCode()` in your implementations of `StandardFeedItemInterface`.

#### From 0.2.0 to 0.3.0
- remove method `getFeedItemRepository()` from all implementations and usages of `FeedConfigInterface`.

#### From 0.1.0 to 0.2.0
- Rename all implementations and usages of `FeedItemInterface::getItemId()` to `getId()`.
- Rename all implementations and usages of `FeedItemCustomValuesProviderInterface` to `HeurekaCategoryNameProviderInterface`.
- If you are using custom values in your implementation, you need to implement interfaces from package [shopsys/plugin-interface](https://github.com/shopsys/plugin-interface) (see [how to work with data storage interface](https://github.com/shopsys/plugin-interface#data-storage)).

### [shopsys/plugin-interface]
#### From 0.2.0 to 0.3.0
- all implementations of `DataStorageInterface` now must have implemented method `getAll()` for getting all saved data indexed by keys

### [shopsys/project-base]
#### From 2.0.0-beta.21.0 to 7.0.0-alpha1      
- manual upgrade from this version will be very hard because of BC-breaking extraction of [shopsys/framework](https://github.com/shopsys/framework)  
    - at this moment the core is not easily extensible by your individual functionality  
    - before upgrading to the new architecture you should upgrade to Dockerized architecture of `2.0.0-beta.21.0`  
    - the upgrade will require overriding or extending of all classes now located in  
    [shopsys/framework](https://github.com/shopsys/framework) that you customized in your forked repository  
    - it would be wise to wait with the upgrade until the newly build architecture has matured  
- update custom tests to be compatible with phpunit 7. For further details visit phpunit release announcements [phpunit 6](https://phpunit.de/announcements/phpunit-6.html) and [phpunit 7](https://phpunit.de/announcements/phpunit-7.html) 

#### From 2.0.0-beta.20.0 to 2.0.0-beta.21.0  
- do not longer use Phing targets standards-ci and standards-ci-diff, use standards and standards-diff instead 

#### From 2.0.0-beta.17.0 to 2.0.0-beta.18.0 
- use `SimpleCronModuleInterface` and `IteratedCronModuleInterface` from their new namespace `Shopsys\Plugin\Cron` (instead of `Shopsys\FrameworkBundle\Component\Cron`) 

#### From 2.0.0-beta.16.0 to 2.0.0-beta.17.0  
- coding standards for JS files were added, make sure `phing eslint-check` passes  
    (you can run `phing eslint-fix` to fix some violations automatically)  

#### From 2.0.0-beta.15.0 to 2.0.0-beta.16.0  
- all implementations of `Shopsys\ProductFeed\FeedItemRepositoryInterface` must implement interface `Shopsys\FrameworkBundle\Model\Feed\FeedItemRepositoryInterface` instead  
    - the interface was moved from [shopsys/product-feed-interface](https://github.com/shopsys/product-feed-interface/) to core  
- parameter `email_for_error_reporting` was renamed to `error_reporting_email_to` in `app/config/parameter.yml.dist`,  
    you will be prompted to fill it out again during `composer install`  
- all implementations of `StandardFeedItemInterface` must implement methods `isSellingDenied()` and `getCurrencyCode()`, see [product-feed-interface](https://github.com/shopsys/product-feed-interface/blob/master/UPGRADE.md#from-030-to-040) 

### [shopsys/coding-standards]
#### From 3.x to 4.0
- In order to run all checks, there is new unified way - execute `php vendor/bin/ecs check /path/to/project --config=vendor/shopsys/coding-standards/easy-coding-standard.neon`
    - If you are overriding rules configuration in your project, it is necessary to do so in neon configuration file, see [example bellow](./example-of-custom-configuration-file).
    - See [EasyCodingStandard docs](https://github.com/Symplify/EasyCodingStandard#usage) for more information
##### Example of custom configuration file
###### Version 3.x and lower
```php
// custom phpcs-fixer.php_cs
<?php

$originalConfig = include __DIR__ . '/../vendor/shopsys/coding-standards/build/phpcs-fixer.php_cs';

$originalConfig->getFinder()
    ->exclude('_generated');

return $originalConfig;
```
###### Version 4.0 and higher
