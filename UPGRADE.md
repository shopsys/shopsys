## [From 7.0.0-alpha3 to 7.0.0-alpha4]

### [shopsys/framework]
- move creation of data objects into factories
- already existing data object factories changed their signatures
- to change the last item in admin breadcrumb, use `BreadcrumbOverrider:overrideLastItem(string $label)` instead of `Breadcrumb::overrideLastItem(MenuItem $item)`
- if you've customized the admin menu by using your own `admin_menu.yml`, implement event listeners instead
    - see the [Adding a New Administration Page](/docs/cookbook/adding-a-new-administration-page.md) cookbook for details

### [shopsys/product-feed-google]
- move creation of data objects into factories
- already existing data object factories changed their signatures

### [shopsys/product-feed-heureka]
- move creation of data objects into factories
- already existing data object factories changed their signatures

### [shopsys/product-feed-zbozi]
- move creation of data objects into factories
- already existing data object factories changed their signatures

### [shopsys/microservice-product-search]
- a new experimental microservice was added to the Shopsys Framework
- it needs to be [installed and run](/docs/installation/installation-using-docker-application-setup.md) (and [configured if installed natively](/docs/installation/native-installation.md)) for the product search to work

## [From 7.0.0-alpha2 to 7.0.0-alpha3]

### [shopsys/framework]
- classes in src/Components were revised, refactored and some of them were moved to model,
    for upgrading to newer version, you must go through commits done in [#272](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/272) and reflect the changes of namespaces.
- FriendlyUrlToGenerateRepository: deleted. If you want to define your own data for friendly url generation, do it so by
    implementing the FriendlyUrlDataProviderInterface and tag your service with `shopsys.friendly_url_provider`.
- check changes in src/Model, all *editData*.php were merged into its *Data*.php relatives
- Twig has been updated to version 2.4.8
    - https://symfony.com/blog/twig-how-to-upgrade-to-2-0-deprecation-notices-to-the-rescue
- access multi-domain attributes of entities via their main entity (instead of the usual entity detail)
    - entity domains (eg. `BrandDomain`) should be created, edited and directly accessed only in their main entities (eg. `Brand`) 
    - see [#165 Different approach to multidomain entities](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/165) for details
- `DomainsType` now uses array of booleans indexed by domain IDs instead of array of domain IDs, original behavior can be restored by adding model data transformer `IndexedBooleansToArrayOfIndexesTransformer`
- `CategoryDomain::$hidden` was changed to `CategoryDomain::$enabled` along with related methods (with negated value)
- `PaymentDomain` and `TransportDomain` are now created even for domains on which the entity should not be visible, check your custom queries that work with payments or transports
- instead of using `EntityManagerFacade::clear()` call `clear()` directly on the `EntityManager`
- all *Detail classes were removed:
    - use `CategoryWithLazyLoadedVisibleChildren` instead of `LazyLoadedCategoryDetail`
    - use `CategoryWithLazyLoadedVisibleChildrenFactory::createCategoriesWithLazyLoadedVisibleChildren()` instead of `CategoryDetailFactory::createLazyLoadedDetails()`
    - use `CategoryFacade::getCategoriesWithLazyLoadedVisibleChildrenForParent()` instead of `CategoryFacade::getVisibleLazyLoadedCategoryDetailsForParent()`
    - use `CategoryWithPreloadedChildren` instead of `CategoryDetail`
    - use `CategoryWithPreloadedChildrenFactory::createCategoriesWithPreloadedChildren()` instead of `CategoryDetailFactory::createDetailsHierarchy()`
    - use `CategoryFacade::getVisibleCategoriesWithPreloadedChildrenForDomain()` instead of `CategoryFacade::getVisibleCategoryDetailsForDomain()`
    - use `PaymentFacade::getIndependentBasePricesIndexedByCurrencyId()` instead of `PaymentDetail::$basePricesByCurrencyId`
    - use `TransportFacade::getIndependentBasePricesIndexedByCurrencyId()` instead of `TransportDetail::$basePricesByCurrencyId`
    - `ProductDetail::hasContentForDetailBox()` is not available anymore (it was useless)
    - use `ProductCachedAttributesFacade` for accessing product parameter values and selling price
    - in templates, use Twig function `getProductParameterValues(product)` instead of `productDetail.parameters`
    - in templates, use Twig function `getProductSellingPrice(product)` instead of `productDetail.sellingPrice`

### [shopsys/project-base]
- Twig has been updated to version 2.4.8
    - https://symfony.com/blog/twig-how-to-upgrade-to-2-0-deprecation-notices-to-the-rescue

### [shopsys/coding-standards]
- create your custom `easy-coding-standard.yml` in your project root with your ruleset (you can use predefined ruleset as shown below) 
- in order to run all checks, there is new unified way - execute `php vendor/bin/ecs check /path/to/project`
- see [EasyCodingStandard docs](https://github.com/Symplify/EasyCodingStandard#usage) for more information
#### Example of custom configuration file
```yaml
#easy-coding-standard.yml
imports:
    - { resource: '%vendor_dir%/shopsys/coding-standards/easy-coding-standard.yml' }
parameters:
    exclude_files:
        - '*/ignored_folder/*'
    skip:
        ObjectCalisthenics\Sniffs\Files\FunctionLengthSniff:
            - '*/src/file.php'
```

### [shopsys/product-feed-google]
- Twig has been updated to version 2.4.8
    - https://symfony.com/blog/twig-how-to-upgrade-to-2-0-deprecation-notices-to-the-rescue
    
### [shopsys/product-feed-heureka]
- Twig has been updated to version 2.4.8
    - https://symfony.com/blog/twig-how-to-upgrade-to-2-0-deprecation-notices-to-the-rescue
    
### [shopsys/product-feed-heureka-delivery]
- Twig has been updated to version 2.4.8
    - https://symfony.com/blog/twig-how-to-upgrade-to-2-0-deprecation-notices-to-the-rescue
    
### [shopsys/product-feed-zbozi]
- Twig has been updated to version 2.4.8
    - https://symfony.com/blog/twig-how-to-upgrade-to-2-0-deprecation-notices-to-the-rescue

## [From 7.0.0-alpha1 to 7.0.0-alpha2]
### [shopsys/project-base]   
- check changes in the `docker-compose.yml` template you used, there were a couple of important changes you need to replicate 
    - easiest way is to overwrite your `docker-compose.yml` with by the appropriate template 
- on *nix systems, fill your UID and GID (you can run `id -u` and `id -g` to obtain them) into Docker build arguments `www_data_uid` and `www_data_gid` and rebuild your image via `docker-compose up --build` 
- change owner of the files in shared volume to `www-data` from the container by running `docker exec -u root shopsys-framework-php-fpm chown -R www-data /var/www/html` 
    - the user has shared UID, so you will be able to access it as well from the host machine 
    - shared volume with postgres data should be owned by `postgres` user: `docker exec -u root shopsys-framework-php-fpm chown -R postgres /var/www/html/var/postgres-data` 
- if you were using a mounted volume to share Composer cache with the container, change the target directory from `/root/.composer` to `/home/www-data/.composer` 
    - in such case, you should change the owner as well by running `docker exec -u root shopsys-framework-php-fpm chown -R www-data /home/www-data/.composer` 

## Before monorepo 
Before we managed to implement monorepo for our packages, we had slightly different versions for each of our package, 
that's why is this section formatted differently.  

### [shopsys/product-feed-heureka]
#### From 0.4.2 to 0.5.0
- requires possibility of extending the CRUD of categories via `shopsys.crud_extension` of type `category`
- requires update of [shopsys/plugin-interface](https://github.com/shopsys/plugin-interface) to version `^0.3.0`
and [shopsys/product-feed-interface](https://github.com/shopsys/product-feed-interface) to `^0.5.0`

#### From 0.2.0 to 0.2.1
- See [Upgrading of shopsys/product-feed-interface](https://github.com/shopsys/product-feed-interface/blob/master/UPGRADE.md#from-030-to-040)

#### From 0.1.1 to 0.2.0
- See [Upgrading of shopsys/product-feed-interface](https://github.com/shopsys/product-feed-interface/blob/master/UPGRADE.md#from-010-to-030)

### [shopsys/product-feed-interface]
#### From 0.4.0 to 0.5.0
- implement method `getMainCategoryId()` in your implementations of `StandardFeedItemInterface`.

#### From 0.3.0 to 0.4.0
- implement method `isSellingDenied()` for all implementations of `StandardFeedItemInterface`.
- you have to take care of filtering of non-sellable items in implementations of `FeedConfigInterface::processItems()` 
in your product feed plugin because the instances of `StandardFeedItemInterface` passed as an argument can be non-sellable now.
- implement method `getAdditionalInformation()` in your implementations of `FeedConfigInterface`.
- implement method `getCurrencyCode()` in your implementations of `StandardFeedItemInterface`.

#### From 0.2.0 to 0.3.0

- Rename all implementations and usages of `FeedItemInterface::getItemId()` to `getId()`.
- Rename all implementations and usages of `FeedItemCustomValuesProviderInterface` to `HeurekaCategoryNameProviderInterface`.
- If you are using custom values in your implementation, you need to implement interfaces from package [shopsys/plugin-interface](https://github.com/shopsys/plugin-interface) (see [how to work with data storage interface](https://github.com/shopsys/plugin-interface#data-storage)).

### [shopsys/plugin-interface]
#### From 0.2.0 to 0.3.0
- all implementations of `DataStorageInterface` now must have implemented method `getAll()` for getting all saved data indexed by keys

### [shopsys/project-base]
#### From 2.0.0-beta.21.0 to 7.0.0-alpha1      
- manual upgrade from this version will be very hard because of BC-breaking extraction of [shopsys/framework](https://github.com/shopsys/framework)  
    - at this moment the core is not easily extensible by your individual functionality  
    - before upgrading to the new architecture you should upgrade to Dockerized architecture of `2.0.0-beta.21.0`  
    - the upgrade will require overriding or extending of all classes now located in  
    [shopsys/framework](https://github.com/shopsys/framework) that you customized in your forked repository  
    - it would be wise to wait with the upgrade until the newly build architecture has matured  
- update custom tests to be compatible with phpunit 7. For further details visit phpunit release announcements [phpunit 6](https://phpunit.de/announcements/phpunit-6.html) and [phpunit 7](https://phpunit.de/announcements/phpunit-7.html) 

#### From 2.0.0-beta.20.0 to 2.0.0-beta.21.0  
- do not longer use Phing targets standards-ci and standards-ci-diff, use standards and standards-diff instead 

#### From 2.0.0-beta.17.0 to 2.0.0-beta.18.0 
- use `SimpleCronModuleInterface` and `IteratedCronModuleInterface` from their new namespace `Shopsys\Plugin\Cron` (instead of `Shopsys\FrameworkBundle\Component\Cron`) 

#### From 2.0.0-beta.16.0 to 2.0.0-beta.17.0  
- coding standards for JS files were added, make sure `phing eslint-check` passes  
    (you can run `phing eslint-fix` to fix some violations automatically)  

#### From 2.0.0-beta.15.0 to 2.0.0-beta.16.0  
- all implementations of `Shopsys\ProductFeed\FeedItemRepositoryInterface` must implement interface `Shopsys\FrameworkBundle\Model\Feed\FeedItemRepositoryInterface` instead  
    - the interface was moved from [shopsys/product-feed-interface](https://github.com/shopsys/product-feed-interface/) to core  
- parameter `email_for_error_reporting` was renamed to `error_reporting_email_to` in `app/config/parameter.yml.dist`,  
    you will be prompted to fill it out again during `composer install`  
- all implementations of `StandardFeedItemInterface` must implement methods `isSellingDenied()` and `getCurrencyCode()`, see [product-feed-interface](https://github.com/shopsys/product-feed-interface/blob/master/UPGRADE.md#from-030-to-040) 

### [shopsys/coding-standards]
#### From 3.x to 4.0
- In order to run all checks, there is new unified way - execute `php vendor/bin/ecs check /path/to/project --config=vendor/shopsys/coding-standards/easy-coding-standard.neon`
    - If you are overriding rules configuration in your project, it is necessary to do so in neon configuration file, see [example bellow](./example-of-custom-configuration-file).
    - See [EasyCodingStandard docs](https://github.com/Symplify/EasyCodingStandard#usage) for more information
##### Example of custom configuration file
###### Version 3.x and lower
```php
// custom phpcs-fixer.php_cs
<?php

$originalConfig = include __DIR__ . '/../vendor/shopsys/coding-standards/build/phpcs-fixer.php_cs';

$originalConfig->getFinder()
    ->exclude('_generated');

return $originalConfig;
```
###### Version 4.0 and higher
```neon
#custom-coding-standard.neon
includes:
    - vendor/symplify/easy-coding-standard/config/psr2-checkers.neon
    - vendor/shopsys/coding-standards/shopsys-coding-standard.neon
parameters:
    exclude_files:
        - *_generated/*
