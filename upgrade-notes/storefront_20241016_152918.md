#### Add Convertim checkout ([#3499](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/3499))

-   this includes mapping data for cart, tranports, payments and stores
-   use env variable `CONVERTIM_ENABLED_DOMAIN_IDS` (similarly as variable `LUIGIS_BOX_ENABLED_DOMAIN_IDS`) to specifiy which domains should have convertim enabled
-   if enabled, when clicking on next step in cart (transport and payment) the convertim checkout will be used instead
-   see #project-base-diff to update your project
