#### Add Convertim checkout ([#3499](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/3499))

-   this includes mapping data for cart, tranports, payments and stores
-   use env variable `CONVERTIM_UUID_DOMAIN_X` to specifiy correct `convertimUuid` with specific config for this particular domain
    -   each domain can have different convertim config for currency, language etc.
    -   if empty or not provided, the current checkout process is used instead
    -   if enabled, when clicking on next step in cart (transport and payment) the convertim checkout will be used instead
-   see #project-base-diff to update your project
