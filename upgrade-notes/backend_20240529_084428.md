#### Movement of features from project-base to packages

-   in this version, there are quite a lot of features that have been moved from `project-base` to the packages, mostly to the `framework` and the `frontend-api` package
-   each section in the upgrade guide contains a link to the `project-base` diff and besides the particular upgrade instructions, there is also a list of the moved features you should be aware of (if there are any)
-   if your project was originally not developed from the Commerce Cloud version, or it was developed on a version lower than `v13.0.0`, these feature movements should not affect you during the upgrade
-   otherwise, you might need to adjust your project to the changes:
    -   if you had no custom changes in the moved features, you should be fine, you can safely remove the features from your project and use the ones from the packages (project-base diff in each section will help you with that)
    -   if you had custom changes in the moved features, you will need to adjust your project to the changes
        -   you should remove everything that was not modified in your project and keep just the custom changes using the recommended ways of the [framework extensibility](https://docs.shopsys.com/en/latest/extensibility/)
    -   one way or another, you should pay a special attention to the database migrations that were added with the feature movement. If they suit your needs, you should keep them and remove the original migrations from your project, otherwise, you should skip the newly added migrations.
