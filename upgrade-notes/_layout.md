# UPGRADING FROM 14.x to 15.0

The releases of Shopsys Platform adhere to the [Backward Compatibility Promise](https://docs.shopsys.com/en/latest/contributing/backward-compatibility-promise/) to make the upgrades to new versions easier and help long-term maintainability.

## Recommended way of upgrading

Since there are two possible scenarios for using Shopsys Platform, instructions are divided into these scenarios.

### You use our packages only

Follow the instructions in relevant sections, e.g. `shopsys/coding-standards` or `shopsys/http-smoke-testing`.

### You are developing a project based on the project-base repository

-   upgrade only your composer dependencies and follow the instructions in the guide below
-   upgrade locally first - after you fix all issues caused by the upgrade, commit your changes, test your application, and then continue with a deployment onto your server
-   upgrade one version at a time:
    -   start with a working application
    -   upgrade to the next version
    -   fix all the issues you encounter
    -   repeat
-   check the instructions in all sections; any of them could be relevant to you
-   the typical upgrade sequence should be:
    -   run `docker compose down --volumes` to turn off your containers
    -   _(macOS only)_ run `mutagen-compose down --volumes` instead
    -   follow upgrade notes in the _Infrastructure_ section (related to `docker-compose.yml`, `Dockerfile`, docker containers, `nginx.conf`, `php.ini`, etc.)
    -   _(MacOS, Windows only)_ run `docker-sync start` to create volumes
    -   run `docker compose build --no-cache --pull` to build your images without cache and with the latest version
    -   run `docker compose up -d --force-recreate --remove-orphans` to start the application again
    -   update the `shopsys/*` dependencies in `composer.json` to the version you are upgrading to
        -   e.g., `"shopsys/framework": "v7.0.0"`
    -   follow upgrade notes in the _Composer dependencies_ section (related with `composer.json`)
    -   run `composer update shopsys/* --with-dependencies`
    -   update the `@shopsys/framework` package in your `package.json` (in "dependencies" section) to the version you are upgrading to
        -   eg. `"@shopsys/framework": "9.0.4",`
    -   run `npm install` to update the NPM dependencies
    -   follow all upgrade notes you have not done yet
    -   run `php phing clean`
    -   run `php phing db-migrations` to run the database migrations
    -   test your app locally
    -   commit your changes
    -   run `composer update` to update the rest of your dependencies, test the app again, and commit `composer.lock`
-   if any of the database migrations do not suit you, there is an option to skip it; see [our Database Migrations docs](https://docs.shopsys.com/en/latest/introduction/database-migrations/#reordering-and-skipping-migrations)
-   we may miss something even if we care a lot about these instructions. In case something doesn't work after the upgrade, you'll find more information in the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md)
