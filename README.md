# Shopsys Framework
Shopsys Framework is a **fully functional ecommerce platform for businesses transitioning into tech-companies with their own software development team**. 
It contains the most common B2C and B2B features for online stores, and its infrastructure is prepared for high scalability.

Shopsys Framework is **the fruit of our 15 years of experience in creating custom-made online stores and it’s dedicated to best in-house devs teams who work with online stores with tens of millions of Euros of turnover per year**. 

Our platform’s **architecture is modern and corresponds to the latest trends in the production of software for leading ecommerce solutions**. 
Deployment and scaling of our system are comfortable thanks to the use of the containerization and orchestration concepts (**Docker, Kubernetes**). 
The platform is based on one of the best PHP frameworks on the market - **Symfony**.

## Current State and a Roadmap

### State in March 2018
Shopsys Framework is fully functional e-commerce platform with all basic functionality all e-commerce sites needs:
* product catalogue
* registered customers
* basic orders management
* back-end administration
* front-end full-text search and product filtering
* 3-step ordering process
* basic CMS
* support for several currencies, languages, and domains
* full friendly URL for main entities

Last stable release of Shopsys 6.1 was internally published at the beginning of 2018 and on this version we created several big B2C and B2B projects.
Experience we got through implementations lead us to ideas and plans for next version of our Shopsys Framework.
The main change is a bigger focus on performance and scalability and significant architecture changes which will provide easy upgradability.
You can read a full article about our goals
[on our blog](https://blog.shopsys.com/shopsys-framework-goals-for-the-beta-and-the-stabile-version-9facf4763376).

Shopsys Framework is currently in the process of architecture refactoring.
Because of this fact, there will be lots of BC breaks in next few months and architecture is not consistent at the moment.
**So we strictly recommend to use the last stable version of Shopsys 6.1 for production - contact us and we will provide you the access for free.**

### Summer 2018 - Alpha
* Experimental projects to validate upgradability
* Heavy performance testing
* Security audits

### September 2018 - Open beta
* Performance optimization through Elasticsearch, Redis, PostgreSQL
* Full core upgradability
* GDPR compliance
* First modules

### February 2019 - Stable version
* Ready to scale
* Asynchronous Processing (RabbitMQ)
* API for front-end applications
* Module store (10 modules)
* Best practice manuals

## How to Start a New Project
The *shopsys/shopsys* package is a monolithic repository, a single development environment, for management of all parts of Shopsys Framework.
See more information about the monorepo approach in [the Monorepo article](./docs/introduction/monorepo.md).

For the purposes of building a new project use our [shopsys/project-base](https://github.com/shopsys/project-base),
which is fully ready as the base for building your Shopsys Framework project.

We recommend to choose **installation via Docker** because it is the easiest and fastest way to start using Shopsys Framework.
Docker contains complete development environment necessary for running your application.
In the future we want to add new technologies to Shopsys Framework (e.g. ElasticSearch).
**Updating your development environment to use these technologies will be very easy with Docker**
because such an update will be done just by running `docker-compose build`.
And that is all!

For more detailed instructions, follow one of the installation guides:

* [Installation via Docker (recommended)](docs/installation/installation-using-docker.md)
* [Native installation](docs/installation/native-installation.md)
