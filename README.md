[![Build Status - master](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/workflows/Docker%20build/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Docker+build%22+branch%3A%22master%22)

Shopsys Framework is a **fully functional ecommerce platform for businesses transitioning into tech-companies with their own software development team**.
It contains the most common B2C and B2B features for online stores, and its infrastructure is prepared for high scalability.

Shopsys Framework is **the fruit of our 16 years of experience in creating custom-made online stores and it’s dedicated to best in-house devs teams who work with online stores with tens of millions of Euros of turnover per year**.

Our platform’s **architecture is modern and corresponds to the latest trends in the production of software for leading ecommerce solutions**.
Deployment and scaling of our system are comfortable thanks to the use of the containerization and orchestration concepts (**Docker, Kubernetes**).
The platform is based on one of the best PHP frameworks on the market - **Symfony**.
