[![Build Status - master](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/workflows/Docker%20build/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Docker+build%22+branch%3A%22master%22)

Shopsys Platform is a **fully functional e-commerce solution for businesses transitioning into tech companies with their own software development team**.
It contains the most common B2C and B2B features for online stores, and its infrastructure is prepared for high scalability.

Shopsys Platform is **the fruit of our 16 years of experience in creating custom-made online stores, and it’s dedicated to the best in-house devs teams who work with online stores with tens of millions of Euros of turnover per year**.

Our platform’s **architecture is modern and corresponds to the latest trends in the production of software for leading e-commerce solutions**.
Deployment and scaling of our system are comfortable thanks to containerization and orchestration concepts (**Docker, Kubernetes**).
The platform is based on one of the best PHP frameworks on the market - **Symfony**.
