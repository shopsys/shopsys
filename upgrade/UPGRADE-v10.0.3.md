## Coding standards

- FE API: all article user errors now provide user error code ([#2493](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/2493))
     - there is a new sniff enabled (`ForbiddenClassesSniff`) that disallows direct usage of the following classes:
          - `Overblog\GraphQLBundle\Error\UserError`
          - `GraphQL\Error\UserError`
     - instead of these classes, you should use suitable implementations of `UserErrorWithCodeInterface`
