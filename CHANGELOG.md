- [#165 Different approach to multidomain entities](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/165)
    - multi-domain entities were changed so they are used similarly to translations
    - main entities have a bidirectional association to a collection of its entity domains (eg. `BrandDomain`)
        - only the main entity has access to its entity domains
        - multi-domain attributes are accessed via the main entity
    - the main entities are responsible for creating and editing its entity domains
        - entity domain factories such as `BrandDomainFactory` were removed
    - entity domains have their own IDs instead of compound primary keys
    - entities that were modified: `Brand`, `Product`, `Category`, `Payment` and `Transport`
    - `BrandEditFormType`, `BrandDetail` and `BrandDetailFactory` were removed as they were no longer necessary
    - `DomainsType` now uses array of booleans indexed by domain IDs instead of array of domain IDs to be consistent with the behavior of `MultidomainType`
    - `CategoryDomain::$hidden` was changed to `CategoryDomain::$enabled` in sake of consistency
    - `PaymentDomain` and `TransportDomain` are now created even for domains on which the entity should not be visible (to allow for other multi-domain entities and in the sake of consistency)

## 7.0.0-alpha1 - 2018-04-12
- We are releasing version 7 (open-source project known as Shopsys Framework) to better distinguish it from Shopsys 6

- extracted core functionality of [Shopsys Framework](http://www.shopsys-framework.com/)

    - core functionality includes:
        - all Shopsys-specific Symfony commands
        - model and components with business logic and their data fixtures

## Before monorepo
Before we managed to implement monorepo for our packages, we had slightly different versions for each of our package, we had stored our packages on internal server so we dont have PR available.
That's why is this section formatted differently.

- dependency [shopsys/product-feed-interface](https://github.com/shopsys/product-feed-interface/) upgraded from 0.2.1 to 0.3.0
- it is no longer needed to redeclare feed plugin's implementations of `FeedConfigInterface` in `services.yml`
    - decision about providing proper instance of `FeedItemRepositoryInterface` is made in `FeedConfigFacade`
- FeedConfigRepository renamed to `FeedConfigRegistry` 
    - it is not fetching data from Doctrine as other repositories, it only serves as a container for registering services of specific type
    - similar to `PluginDataFixtureRegistry` or `PluginCrudExtensionRegistry`
- `UknownPluginDataFixtureException` renamed to `UnknownPluginCrudExtensionTypeException` because of a typo 
- `FeedConfigRegistry` now contains all FeedConfigs in one array (indexed by type)

- sender email for error reporting is now configured in [`parameters.yml.dist`](./project-base/app/config/parameters.yml.dist)
- reimplemented `CategoriesType` (@Petr Heinz)
    - it now extends `CollectionType` instead of `ChoiceType`
    - it loads only those categories that are needed to show all selected categories in a tree, not all of them
    - collapsed categories can be loaded via AJAX
- `CategoryRepository::findById()` now uses `find()` method of Doctrine repository instead of query builder so it can use cached results 
- it is possible to mention occurrences of an image size in [`images.yml`](./project-base/src/Shopsys/ShopBundle/Resources/config/images.yml) 
    - previously they were directly in `ImageController`
    - they are not translatable anymore (too hard to maintain)

##### Removed
- email for error reporting removed from [`parameters_test.yml.dist`](./project-base/app/config/parameters_test.yml.dist)
- removed unused private properties from classes
