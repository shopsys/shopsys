# UPGRADING FROM 14.x to 15.0

The releases of Shopsys Platform adhere to the [Backward Compatibility Promise](https://docs.shopsys.com/en/latest/contributing/backward-compatibility-promise/) to make the upgrades to new versions easier and help long-term maintainability.

## Recommended way of upgrading

Since there are two possible scenarios for using Shopsys Platform, instructions are divided into these scenarios.

### You use our packages only

Follow the instructions in relevant sections, e.g. `shopsys/coding-standards` or `shopsys/http-smoke-testing`.

### You are developing a project based on the project-base repository

-   upgrade only your composer dependencies and follow the instructions in the guide below
-   upgrade locally first - after you fix all issues caused by the upgrade, commit your changes, test your application, and then continue with a deployment onto your server
-   upgrade one version at a time:
    -   start with a working application
    -   upgrade to the next version
    -   fix all the issues you encounter
    -   repeat
-   check the instructions in all sections; any of them could be relevant to you
-   the typical upgrade sequence should be:
    -   run `docker-compose down --volumes` to turn off your containers
    -   _(macOS only)_ run `mutagen-compose down --volumes` instead
    -   follow upgrade notes in the _Infrastructure_ section (related to `docker-compose.yml`, `Dockerfile`, docker containers, `nginx.conf`, `php.ini`, etc.)
    -   _(MacOS, Windows only)_ run `docker-sync start` to create volumes
    -   run `docker-compose build --no-cache --pull` to build your images without cache and with the latest version
    -   run `docker-compose up -d --force-recreate --remove-orphans` to start the application again
    -   update the `shopsys/*` dependencies in `composer.json` to the version you are upgrading to
        -   e.g., `"shopsys/framework": "v7.0.0"`
    -   follow upgrade notes in the _Composer dependencies_ section (related with `composer.json`)
    -   run `composer update shopsys/* --with-dependencies`
    -   update the `@shopsys/framework` package in your `package.json` (in "dependencies" section) to the version you are upgrading to
        -   eg. `"@shopsys/framework": "9.0.4",`
    -   run `npm install` to update the NPM dependencies
    -   follow all upgrade notes you have not done yet
    -   run `php phing clean`
    -   run `php phing db-migrations` to run the database migrations
    -   test your app locally
    -   commit your changes
    -   run `composer update` to update the rest of your dependencies, test the app again, and commit `composer.lock`
-   if any of the database migrations do not suit you, there is an option to skip it; see [our Database Migrations docs](https://docs.shopsys.com/en/latest/introduction/database-migrations/#reordering-and-skipping-migrations)
-   we may miss something even if we care a lot about these instructions. In case something doesn't work after the upgrade, you'll find more information in the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md)

#### Movement of features from project-base to packages

-   in this version, there are quite a lot of features that have been moved from `project-base` to the packages, mostly to the `framework` and the `frontend-api` package
-   each section in the upgrade guide contains a link to the `project-base` diff and besides the particular upgrade instructions, there is also a list of the moved features you should be aware of (if there are any)
-   if your project was originally not developed from the Commerce Cloud version, or it was developed on a version lower than `v13.0.0`, these feature movements should not affect you during the upgrade
-   otherwise, you might need to adjust your project to the changes:
    -   if you had no custom changes in the moved features, you should be fine, you can safely remove the features from your project and use the ones from the packages (project-base diff in each section will help you with that)
    -   if you had custom changes in the moved features, you will need to adjust your project to the changes
        -   you should remove everything that was not modified in your project and keep just the custom changes using the recommended ways of the [framework extensibility](https://docs.shopsys.com/en/latest/extensibility/)

-   [features moved](#movement-of-features-from-project-base-to-packages) from project-base to the framework package:
    -   product variants cache in `Shopsys\FrameworkBundle\Model\Product\Elasticsearch\ProductExportRepository`
-   see #project-base-diff to update your project

#### update Elasticsearch index files structure ([#2567](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/2567))

-   elastic index definition files where sorted by order of columns in `ExportRepository` classes. These are not mandatory changes, and you can decide to skip them.
-   add missing properties and remove unnecessary properties from elastic structure
-   changed indent count for json files. These are not mandatory changes, and you can decide to skip them.
-   see #project-base-diff to update your project

#### rename reserved database function `normalize` to non-reserved name `normalized` ([#3072](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/3072))

-   create migration to change `normalize()` function to `normalized()` if you had used it in some indexes, functions, or somewhere else
-   don't forget to rename this function in SQLs in repositories, commands, or somewhere else where is used
-   see #project-base-diff to update your project

#### fix seo pages urls ([#3079](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/3079))

-   this change adds migration `Version20240325165512` that changes friendly urls. If you do not want to change friendly urls in your project, add it as skipped migration to `migrations-lock.yaml`

#### make delivery address fields not nullable ([#2494](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/2494))

-   class `Shopsys\FrameworkBundle\Form\Admin\Customer\DeliveryAddressFormType` was removed
-   check migration `Version20220725104726` if suits your needs
-   following fields in `Shopsys\FrameworkBundle\Model\Customer\DeliveryAddress` are no longer nullable:
    -   `$firstName`
    -   `$lastName`
    -   `$street`
    -   `$city`
    -   `$postcode`
    -   `$country`
-   see #project-base-diff to update your project

#### restrict limit of requests how many can robot ask from eshop ([#2820](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/2820))

-   this change adds migration `Version20230919173422` that adds SEO robot limits to your `robots.txt` file. If you do not want to change it in your project, add it as skipped migration to `migrations-lock.yaml`
-   if you have defined rules for all robots (`User-agent: *`), then you have to manually add these lines to your robots.txt
    ```diff
        User-agent: *
    +   Crawl-delay: 3
    +   Request-rate: 300/1m
    ```
-   see #project-base-diff to update your project

### Storefront

#### added query/mutation name to URL and headers ([#3041](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/3041))

-   queries and mutation names are now part of the request URL, which means query is not made to `/graphql/` but `/graphql/<QueryName>/`
-   if you do not want this, you can skip the changes (ensure there is no `operationNameExchange` used in your URQL client)
-   if you apply this change, it should be easier for you to debug requests in tools like Kibana and also see operation names in browser network tab

#### fix display advert in categories ([#3040](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/3040))

#### refactored different levels of error debugging on SF ([#3033](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/3033))

-   we now have three levels (`console`, `toast-and-console`, `no-debug`) based on which verbose error messages are shown to developers
-   in your projects, you should use constants `isWithConsoleErrorDebugging`, `isWithToastAndConsoleErrorDebugging`,`isWithErrorDebugging` to control different debugging in all places where you handle errors or exceptions
-   docs were rewritten to match this new approach, so you can read them to get a better idea
-   verbose logging was also added for mutations, so if you need to handle this differently, check `errorExchange.ts`
-   added .env.development for SF, so you should put all your env variables for development there, if you need to handle them in a specific way, differently from the app being in production mode

#### refactor mobile menu ([#3035](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/3035))

-   now the whole component is refactored and is included with new design

#### added visitAndWaitForStableDOM for visiting pages in cypress ([#3071](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/3071))

-   change all `cy.visit` to `cy.visitAndWaitForStableDOM`, to make sure that cypress waits for the DOM to be stable before interacting

#### cypress with GUI ([#3069](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/3069))

-   cypress tests can now be run using cypress interactive GUI
-   read the docs (`cypress.md`) for detailed info

#### SF bundle size reduction changes ([#3077](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/3077))

-   we removed `react-dom/server` from the client bundle by removing it from `SeznamMapMarkerLayer`, since we did not use it anywhere else, that was enough for us. If you are using it anywhere else, you should also remove that from the client, as it bloats the bundle
-   URQL is now loaded using dynamic import to load it in a separate chunk, same as other parts of the \_app file, which means you should ideally do it with other large parts of your \_app as well, to separate it into multiple chunks
-   the GQL schema in a JSON format used for teh URQL client is now purified using `@urql/introspection` and the smaller file is used, so keep in mind to change all your imports

```diff
- import schema from 'schema.graphql.json';
+ import schema from 'schema-compressed.graphql.json';
```

-   inside i18n.js, we now report exceptions by sending it to a new Next.js API route `/api/log-exception`, which is done to avoid importing the entire Sentry package on the client, so you should also remove direct imports of Sentry from all the files which are not webpack-compiled, as that has an immense negative effect on performance
-   redis is now blocked from the client bundle by specifying it in the webpack config inside next.config.js, and you should block all other packages which are in your client bundle, but should not be there (check by running `npm run analyze` in the SF folder)

#### GQL generated files split ([#3078](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/3078))

-   you should update all the necessary imports of GQL generated files
    -   remove all imports from `/graphql/generated`
    -   instead import from the given `/graphql/requests/**/*.generated.tsx` file or from `/graphql/types.ts`
-   remove all `Api` suffixes from all generated types
    -   or if you want to keep them, do not accept this change to `codegen-config.ts`:

```diff
- typesSuffix: 'Api',
+
```

#### order process fixes ([#3032](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/3032))

-   to handle access management on order pages, use the new `useOrderPagesAccess` hook, which handles both loading state and possible redirects
-   there was a bug with manual cache updates for mutations which are deduplicated, to fix this for any other mutations you might have, follow the example added to `graphcache.md`
-   move all your cypress API custom commands to `/cypress/support/api.ts`
-   in cache updates, make sure you do not condition your code on properties, which are sometimes not available
    -   this issue was for example present during transport and payment change for logged in user, where it was caused by the manual cache updates being conditioned on the presence of cart UUID, which is never present for a logged in user
    -   in this case, we caused it by now checking the entire response object (cart nullability)
-   make sure you do not make any actions conditioned on presence of transport/payment during the initial renders, as they are null, because the cart is not loaded yet
    -   this issue was for example present during transport and payment pre-selection based on previous order, where because of asynchronicity of zustand store hydration, when the decision was made to pre-select transport/payment from previous order, transport and payment were always null, thus the transport and payment were always pre-selected, even though the user has already changed his decision
-   check that if you provide multiple identical handlers to any type of inputs (such as multiple `onBlur` or `onChange` as we have in `TextInputControlled`), you correctly combine them into a single handler and call that
    -   you can get insipred in the aforementioned `TextInputControlled`
-   use the newly provided `useOnFinishHydrationDefaultValuesPrefill` if you want to prefill your form with default values which might not be available during the initial load (e.g. because of store hydration)
-   fixed issue with email value update in order third step, where the value was not correctly updated, because the update function used an outdated value of the field. Instead, we now use the event target value, which solves this issue
    -   you should check for similar issues in your code, and make sure that any `onBlur` or `onChange` handlers operate on the newest value
-   contact information page (and form) now loads only after cart is fully loaded, which means you can remove any custom async logic which reacts to cart being loaded and depend on it being there from the beginning
-   `CurrentCustomerUser.ts` was removed and the code moved, as it was used only in a single place, so if you are using it in multiple places, you should keep it
-   radiobutton component now does not accept `onChangeCallback` prop anymore, so you should provide your actions and callbacks via `onClick` if you need to to provide "unchecking" functionality, or `onChange` if you do not
-   select component now accepts ID which is given to the select input and can be used for tests and similar
-   `ContactInformationFormWrapper` was renamed to a better-suited `ContactInformationFormContent`, as it does not wrap the form, but rather contains it
-   `deliveryAddressUuid` is now never null, but we operate with an empty string or an actual UUID, which was done for easier operations with the property, so your application does not need to check for null, but you should check your conditions if they correctly check the empty string value (however, it still has to be mapped to null just before sending to API)
-   removed various useEffects for contact information and rather approached the problem from a synchronous and controlled POV
    -   countries are now loaded during SSR, so we do not have to set the default value using useEffect
    -   we do not set delivery address fields based on `deliveryAddressUuid` using useEffect in the form, but rather just put it in the mutation later, which simplifies the logic
    -   we do the same with pickup place details, which required a more complex validation logic, where we validate delivery address fields based on pickup place, delivery address UUID, and currently logged-in user
    -   what this means for you is that you should ideally also avoid these hacky useEffects, ideally only fill your form with the data you (really) need, and map it later for your mutation
    -   you also now cannot expect the contact information form to contain the information from the delivery address selected by UUID (deliveryAddressUuid) and from the pickup place
-   contact information is now removed from store (and session storage) after logout, so you should either not expect it there, or not accept these changes
-   `useCountriesAsSelectOptions` was added to get mapped countries as select options, which uses `mapCountriesToSelectOptions` internally and thus the function is not exported anymore
    `useCountriesAsSelectOptions` should be used to get countries as select options now
-   removed `useHandleContactInformationNonTextChanges` and instead use `onChange` handlers

#### SF large files split ([#3081](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/3081))

-   icons are now in separate files, so update your imports and do the same with any further icons you might have
-   large GTM files were split, so update your imports and do the same to any other GTM files you might have
-   large helper files were split, so update your imports and do the same to any other helper files you might have
-   large hook files were split, so update your imports and do the same to any other hook files you might have
-   `useQueryParams` hook was split into separate files, so update your code and imports
-   `hooks` and `helpers` folders were unified under a new `utils` name, so update your imports and move your files there

#### codegen types and values differentiation ([#3085](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/3085))

-   all codegen-generated GQL types now have a `Type` prefix (suffix did not work as expected)
-   you should update all your imports and make sure to apply the new config
-   you should also regenerate your codegen-generated files to make sure your own files apply the new config

#### cypress make command fix ([#3090](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/3090))

#### cypress stability fixes ([#3093](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/3093))

-   make sure all your links which wait for the `href` to be fetched dynamically use the same styling even before the `href` is available
    -   you can use the newly provided `linkPlaceholderTwClass` as seen below

```diff
components={{
   lnk1: privacyPolicyArticleUrl ? (
       <Link isExternal href={privacyPolicyArticleUrl} target="_blank" />
   ) : (
-       <span />
   ),
}}
components={{
   lnk1: privacyPolicyArticleUrl ? (
       <Link isExternal href={privacyPolicyArticleUrl} target="_blank" />
   ) : (
+       <span className={linkPlaceholderTwClass} />
   ),
}}
```

#### fixed incorrect keys in cache exchange config ([#3094](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/3094))
