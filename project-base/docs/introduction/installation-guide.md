# Installation Guide (obsolete)
*This guide is obsolete, because recommended way to install Shopsys Framework is via Docker. This guide should be completely correct, but it has not been tested since Redis has been added as prerequisite.*
 
This guide provides instructions how to install Shopsys Framework on your local machine as a server.
If you would like to use a prepared Docker container instead go to [Installation Using Docker](../docker/installation/installation-using-docker.md).

## Requirements
First of all, you need to install the following software on your system:

* [GIT](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
* [PostgreSQL 9.4](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Detailed_installation_guides) (On Windows OS, we recommend to use [EnterpriseDB PostgreSQL distribution](https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/postgres-postgresql-downloads#windows))
* [PHP 7.1 - 7.2](http://php.net/manual/en/install.php) (configure your `php.ini` by [Required PHP Configuration](required-php-configuration.md))
* [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#globally)
* [Node.js 4.x](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* [npm 2.x](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (npm is automatically installed when you install Node.js)
* [Redis](https://redis.io/topics/quickstart)

*Note: The names link to the appropriate installation guide or download page.* 

After that, you can follow the steps below in order to install and configure Shopsys Framework.

## Steps
### 1. Create new project from Shopsys Framework sources
```
composer create-project shopsys/project-base --stability=alpha --keep-vcs
cd project-base
```
Notes: 
- The `--keep-vcs` option keeps the GIT history of `shopsys/project-base` in your new project

### 2. Install dependencies and configure parameters
Composer will prompt you to set main parameters (`app/config/parameters.yml`):

| Name                              | Description                                                                   |

| `mailer_host`                     | ...                                                                           |
| `mailer_user`                     | ...                                                                           |
| `mailer_password`                 | ...                                                                           |
| `mailer_disable_delivery`         | set to `true` if you don't want to send any e-mails                           |
| `mailer_master_email_address`     | set if you want to send all e-mails to one address (useful for development)   |

Composer will then prompt you to set parameters for testing environment (`app/config/parameters_test.yml`):

| Name                              | Description                                                                   |

| `overwrite_domain_url`            | overwrites URL of all domains for acceptance testing (set to `~` to disable)  |

| `test_database_password`          | ...                                                                           |

#### Choose environment type
For development choose `n` when asked `Build in production environment? (Y/n)`.

It will set the environment in your application to `dev` (this will, for example, show Symfony Web Debug Toolbar).

### 3. Configure domains
Create `domains_urls.yml` from `domains_urls.yml.dist`.
```
cp app/config/domains_urls.yml.dist app/config/domains_urls.yml
```
### 4. Create databases
```
php phing db-create
php phing test-db-create
```
### 5. Build application
```
php phing build-demo-dev
php phing img-demo
```
**For solutions to commonly encountered problems during build see section [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) below or you might want to check [Required PHP Configuration](required-php-configuration.md).**

*Tip: See introduction into [Phing Targets](phing-targets.md) to learn how can you easily accomplish some common tasks.*

### 6. Run integrated HTTP server
```
php bin/console server:run
```
*Note: If you did not use default domain URLs in step 4 you should run `php bin/console server:run <your-domain-address>`.*

### 7. See it in your browser!
Open [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/) to see running application.

You can also login into the administration section on [http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/) with default credentials:
* Username: `admin` or `superadmin` (the latter has access to advanced options)
* Password: `admin123`

## Troubleshooting
Here are some issues you may encounter during installation and how to solve them: 

### Phing target db-drop fails because database user is not an owner of schema "public"
Error message:
```
[Doctrine\DBAL\Exception\DriverException]
An exception occurred while executing 'DROP SCHEMA IF EXISTS public CASCADE':
SQLSTATE[42501]: Insufficient privilege: 7 ERROR:  must be owner of schema public
```

Default owner of schema `public` in any new database is user `postgres`.

In order to enable Phing to drop schema `public` you must change the ownership of public schema in your database by running the following command:
```
psql --username postgres --dbname <database_name> --command "ALTER SCHEMA public OWNER TO <database_user>"
psql --username postgres --dbname <test_database_name> --command "ALTER SCHEMA public OWNER TO <database_user>"
```

### Phing target db-create fails on MissingLocaleException
Error message:
```
[Shopsys\FrameworkBundle\Command\Exception\MissingLocaleException]                                                                                    
It looks like your operating system does not support locale "cs_CZ.utf8". Please visit docs/introduction/installation-guide.md for more details.

[Doctrine\DBAL\Exception\DriverException]                                                                           
An exception occurred while executing 'CREATE COLLATION pg_catalog."cs_CZ" (LOCALE="cs_CZ"."utf8")':                  
SQLSTATE[22023]: Invalid parameter value: 7 ERROR:  could not create locale "cs_CZ.utf8": No such file or directory  
DETAIL:  The operating system could not find any locale data for the locale name "cs_CZ.utf8".
```

Some features like sorting products by name in the products catalog require your database to contain specific collations in order to be able to sort by locale-specific rules.
Unfortunately, in PostgreSQL locales are operating system dependent, which means that they can be different on each system.
Shopsys Framework normalizes the names of locales present in different systems by creating new collations in the database.

However, if your operating system does not provide the required locales you can try:
* On Linux: Install additional locales to your system (eg. on Debian Linux this can be done by installing [locales-all](https://packages.debian.org/cs/stable/locales-all) package) and restart the database server.
* On Windows: Make sure you use PostgreSQL distribution that supports multiple locales. We recommend to use [EnterpriseDB PostgreSQL distribution](https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/postgres-postgresql-downloads#windows).
* Otherwise: The only other option is to create the database collation mentioned in the exception manually using a locale that your OS supports.
(Note: every OS should support special locale `"C"` or `"POSIX"`.)

### Phing target tests-db fails on test AdministratorRepositoryTest::testGetByValidMultidomainLogin
This error is not likely to occur anymore. 
We added new phing target `timezones-check` that is run during the application build and prevents this error.

Error message:
```
1) Tests\ShopBundle\Database\Model\Administrator\AdministratorRepositoryTest::testGetByValidMultidomainLogin
Shopsys\FrameworkBundle\Model\Administrator\Security\Exception\InvalidTokenException: Administrator with valid multidomain login token validMultidomainLoginToken not found.

.../FrameworkBundle/Model/Administrator/AdministratorRepository.php:69
.../tests/ShopBundle/Database/Model/Administrator/AdministratorRepositoryTest.php:25
```

The problem is that your `timezone` setting in PostgreSQL and `date.timezone` in `php.ini` are different.

Currently, some features are dependent on the fact that time zones in database and PHP are the same. Please set them both to the same timezone.

Timezone used in PostgreSQL can be determined by running the following command:
```
psql --username postgres --dbname <database_name> --command "SHOW timezone"
```

Timezone for PHP can be set in your `php.ini` (usually located in `/etc/php.ini`) by configuration like:
```
date.timezone = "UTC"
```
