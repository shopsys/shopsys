## Development

### Generated GraphQL requests

Requests to API are generated by [GraphQl Code Generator](https://www.graphql-code-generator.com/). The definitions of queries/mutations/fragments are stored in `./graphql/requests`.

After some changes to API you need to regenerate hooks and types, so it's in sync with current state of Frontend API: This is automatically checked on the CI pipeline. If the hooks and types are not regenerated, the pipeline fails.

1. Run `php phing frontend-api-generate-graphql-schema` inside php-fpm container
2. Run `pnpm run gql:codegen` in storefront container
