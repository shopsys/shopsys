This is documentation for Shopsys Framework Storefront.

## Ways to use Shopsys Storefront

There are two ways to use Shopsys Storefront on your machine.
First and easiest way is when you have installed your project using Docker.
With Docker, you have everything running already.
If Docker way is too robust for you or you do not need whole application running, you can run Shopsys Storefront natively.

### Docker way

With Docker, you have Shopsys Storefront already running.
Storefront is running on http://127.0.0.1:3000

#### Restart PNPM

When you change `next.config.js` file, and you want new settings to be applied, you need to restart PNPM.
You might also want to restart PNPM when something is not working correctly.
In such cases, you do not need to stop all running containers and start them again, just to recreate container of the storefront.
To do that run this command outside the container:

```plain
docker-compose up -d --force-recreate storefront
```

### Native way

#### Install all dependencies

```plain
pnpm install
```

#### Start app

```plain
pnpm run dev
```

After this command open http://127.0.0.1:3000/ in your browser.

### Additional commands available for both ways (in Docker way they need to be run inside the storefront container)

#### Build the app for production.

```plain
pnpm run build
```

#### Run the built app in production mode

```plain
pnpm start
```

#### Run eslint for code

```plain
pnpm run lint
```

#### Run eslint and fix code

```plain
pnpm run lint--fix
```

#### Run prettier format code

```plain
pnpm run format
```
