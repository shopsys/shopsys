### Robots.txt

Robots.txt file is server-side rendered dynamically for each domain, so it's possible to serve sitemap links for the currently visited domain.

Any individual desired changes in robots.txt file can be achieved in the `pages/robots.txt.tsx` file, function `getRobotsTxtContent` respectively.

Robots.txt file is available without any necessary additional configurations at the standard location (https://domain/robots.txt)
