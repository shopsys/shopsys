# GTM Event Hooks

These hooks are responsible for handling of asynchronous GTM events according to how React's lifecycle works. They do not return anything, just handle the asynchronous event. They are usually used for events such as page view or list view.

It is triggered every time page (and therefore products) change.

```typescript
export const useGtmPaginatedProductListViewEvent = (
    paginatedProducts: ListedProductFragmentApi[] | undefined, // array of displayed products, if loaded and available
    startCursor: string | null | undefined, // start cursor used for pagination, if available
    gtmProductListName: GtmProductListNameType, // name of the viewed paginated list
    key: string, // key used to avoid double dispatch of the event, usually URL of the page without GET parameters
    fetching: boolean, // boolean pointer saying if the products are still loading
): void => {
    // function body not included in this code block
};
```
