## Installation
We recommend to choose **installation via Docker** because it is the easiest and fastest way to start using Shopsys Platform.
Docker contains complete development environment necessary for running your application.
In the future we want to add new technologies to Shopsys Platform (e.g. ElasticSearch).
**Updating your development environment to use these technologies will be very easy with Docker**
because such an update will be done just by running `docker-compose build`.
And that is all!

Create new project on Shopsys Platform easily from this package following the [Installation Guide](https://docs.shopsys.com/en/latest/installation/installation-guide/).

## Documentation
