## Installation
We recommend to choose **installation via Docker** because it is the easiest and fastest way to start using Shopsys Framework.
Docker contains complete development environment necessary for running your application.
In the future we want to add new technologies to Shopsys Framework (e.g. ElasticSearch).
**Updating your development environment to use these technologies will be very easy with Docker**
because such an update will be done just by running `docker-compose build`.
And that is all!

Create new project on Shopsys Framework easily from this package following the [Installation Guide](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/blob/master/docs/installation/installation-guide.md).

## Documentation
For documentation of Shopsys Framework itself see [Shopsys Framework Knowledge Base](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/blob/master/docs/index.md).

Documentation of the specific project built on Shopsys Framework should be in [Project Documentation](https://github.com/shopsys/project-base/blob/master/docs/index.md).
