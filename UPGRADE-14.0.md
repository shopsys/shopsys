# UPGRADING FROM 13.x to 14.0.1

The releases of Shopsys Platform adhere to the [Backward Compatibility Promise](https://docs.shopsys.com/en/latest/contributing/backward-compatibility-promise/) to make the upgrades to new versions easier and help long-term maintainability.

## Recommended way of upgrading

Since there are two possible scenarios for using Shopsys Platform, instructions are divided into these scenarios.

### You use our packages only

Follow the instructions in relevant sections, e.g. `shopsys/coding-standards` or `shopsys/http-smoke-testing`.

### You are developing a project based on the project-base repository

-   upgrade only your composer dependencies and follow the instructions in the guide below
-   upgrade locally first - after you fix all issues caused by the upgrade, commit your changes, test your application, and then continue with a deployment onto your server
-   upgrade one version at a time:
    -   start with a working application
    -   upgrade to the next version
    -   fix all the issues you encounter
    -   repeat
-   check the instructions in all sections; any of them could be relevant to you
-   the typical upgrade sequence should be:
    -   run `docker-compose down --volumes` to turn off your containers
    -   _(macOS only)_ run `mutagen-compose down --volumes` instead
    -   follow upgrade notes in the _Infrastructure_ section (related to `docker-compose.yml`, `Dockerfile`, docker containers, `nginx.conf`, `php.ini`, etc.)
    -   _(MacOS, Windows only)_ run `docker-sync start` to create volumes
    -   run `docker-compose build --no-cache --pull` to build your images without cache and with the latest version
    -   run `docker-compose up -d --force-recreate --remove-orphans` to start the application again
    -   update the `shopsys/*` dependencies in `composer.json` to the version you are upgrading to
        -   e.g., `"shopsys/framework": "v7.0.0"`
    -   follow upgrade notes in the _Composer dependencies_ section (related with `composer.json`)
    -   run `composer update shopsys/* --with-dependencies`
    -   update the `@shopsys/framework` package in your `package.json` (in "dependencies" section) to the version you are upgrading to
        -   eg. `"@shopsys/framework": "9.0.4",`
    -   run `npm install` to update the NPM dependencies
    -   follow all upgrade notes you have not done yet
    -   run `php phing clean`
    -   run `php phing db-migrations` to run the database migrations
    -   test your app locally
    -   commit your changes
    -   run `composer update` to update the rest of your dependencies, test the app again, and commit `composer.lock`
-   if any of the database migrations do not suit you, there is an option to skip it; see [our Database Migrations docs](https://docs.shopsys.com/en/latest/introduction/database-migrations/#reordering-and-skipping-migrations)
-   we may miss something even if we care a lot about these instructions. In case something doesn't work after the upgrade, you'll find more information in the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md)

#### Movement of features from project-base to packages

-   in this version, there are quite a lot of features that have been moved from `project-base` to the packages, mostly to the `framework` and the `frontend-api` package
-   each section in the upgrade guide contains a link to the `project-base` diff and besides the particular upgrade instructions, there is also a list of the moved features you should be aware of (if there are any)
-   if your project was originally not developed from the Commerce Cloud version, or it was developed on a version lower than `v13.0.0`, these feature movements should not affect you during the upgrade
-   otherwise, you might need to adjust your project to the changes:
    -   if you had no custom changes in the moved features, you should be fine, you can safely remove the features from your project and use the ones from the packages (project-base diff in each section will help you with that)
    -   if you had custom changes in the moved features, you will need to adjust your project to the changes
        -   you should remove everything that was not modified in your project and keep just the custom changes using the recommended ways of the [framework extensibility](https://docs.shopsys.com/en/latest/extensibility/)
    -   one way or another, you should pay a special attention to the database migrations that were added with the feature movement. If they suit your needs, you should keep them and remove the original migrations from your project, otherwise, you should skip the newly added migrations.

<!-- Insert upgrade instructions in the following format:
- general instruction ([#<PR number>](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/<PR number>))
    - additional instructions

-   see [project-base-diff](https://github.com/shopsys/project-base/commit/44fc66d8eb9a87257b6956a8ca063d261796d765) to update your project

#### add Luigi's Box Category feed and check your feeds ([#2926](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/2926))

-   see [project-base-diff](https://github.com/shopsys/project-base/commit/2a4af78b28a5b7b227819c7800b353557ec0f27d) to update your project

#### implemented generic product lists ([#2901](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/2901))

-   the functionality replaces the original implementations of wishlists and product comparisons
-   check `Shopsys\FrameworkBundle\Migrations\Version20231102161313`
    -   the migration handles data transfer from `wishlists`, `wishlist_items`, `comparisons`, and `compared_items` tables to the new `product_lists` and `product_list_items` tables
    -   if you had any custom changes in your wishlist/comparison implementations, you might want to skip the migration in `migrations_lock.yaml` file and handle the data transfer yourself

```

-   `Shopsys\FrontendApiBundle\Model\Resolver\Products\Exception\ProductNotFoundUserError::CODE` changed its visibility from `protected` to `public`
-   `Shopsys\FrontendApiBundle\Model\Resolver\Products\ProductsQuery::__construct()` changed its interface:

    public function __construct(
        // ...
        protected readonly ProductConnectionFactory $productConnectionFactory,
+       protected readonly DataLoaderInterface $productsVisibleAndSortedByIdsBatchLoader,
+       protected readonly ProductListFacade $productListFacade,
```

-   [features moved](#movement-of-features-from-project-base-to-packages) to the `frontend-api` package:
    -   part of FE API data loaders, namely `productsVisibleByIdsBatchLoader`, `productsVisibleAndSortedByIdsBatchLoader`, and `productsSellableByIdsBatchLoader`
-   see [project-base-diff](https://github.com/shopsys/project-base/commit/bf6a4130348660b41b509a8a182e752d24fb4222) to update your project

#### remove backend API ([#2937](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/2937))

-   if you used the backend API, you need to implement it by yourself
-   `Shopsys\FrameworkBundle\Model\Product\ProductFacade::findByProductQueryParams()` method has been removed
-   `Shopsys\FrameworkBundle\Model\Product\ProductRepository::findByProductQueryParams()` method has been removed

#### annotation fixer: get property type from typehint when the annotation is missing ([#2934](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/2934))

-   run `php phing annotations-fix` in `php-fpm` container to fix the annotations
-   see [project-base-diff](https://github.com/shopsys/project-base/commit/7e37b83decbab33e1fbc4bf4e1fe741f719acda0) to update your project

#### handle image resizing by image proxy ([#2924](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/2924))

-   if you are using VSH CDN, the image proxy is already set up for you in `imageResizer.php` file.
-   for local development without CDN, the `imageResizer.php` file has a setup for local imgProxy instance
-   for any other CDN, you can use the `imageResizer.php` file as well, but you have to set up the proxy yourself
-   instead of defining various image sizes and additional sizes in `images.yaml`, you need to define the image sizes directly in storefront code (use `components/Basic/Image/Image.tsx` component for that purpose)
-   during the deployment of the new version, the images structure will be migrated automatically
    -   **we highly recommend to back up your images (i.e. `web/content/images/` in your S3 bucket) before the deployment and test the migration on devel/beta stage thoroughly to be sure everything works as expected for your data structure**
    -   all the entity images in all other than `original` folders will be removed, and images from `original` folders will be moved one folder up
    -   check the `docker/nginx/nginx.conf` file - there is a setup for redirecting the legacy image URLs to the new ones. The setup uses a regex that contains all the legacy image sizes. If you use a different image sizes configuration, you need to modify the sizes in the regex accordingly.
        -   the same must be done in `app/orchestration/kubernetes/configmap/nginx-storefront.yaml` file (if you do not have the file in your project yet, you have to create it, see https://github.com/shopsys/deployment#customize-deployment for more information)
    -   see `Shopsys\FrameworkBundle\Command\MigrateImagesCommand` for more details
-   to have the image proxy container working properly on CI, you might need to upgrade Docker on your CI server to version `20.10.24` or higher
    -   see https://github.com/docker-library/golang/issues/467 for more details
    -   e.g. for Debian distributions, simple `apt upgrade` should do the trick
    -   the same applies to your localhost
-   `Shopsys\FrameworkBundle\Component\Image\AdditionalImageData` class has been removed
-   the following exceptions were removed from `Shopsys\FrameworkBundle\Component\Image\Config\Exception` namespace:
    -   `DuplicateMediaException`
    -   `DuplicateSizeNameException`
    -   `ImageAdditionalSizeNotFoundException`
    -   `ImageSizeNotFoundException`
    -   `WidthAndHeightMissingException`
    -   `ImageAdditionalSizeConfig`
-   `Shopsys\FrameworkBundle\Component\Image\Config\ImageConfig` class has been changed:
    -   constants `ORIGINAL_SIZE_NAME` and `DEFAULT_SIZE_NAME` were removed
    -   method `getEntityName()` is now strictly typed
    -   method `getImageSizeConfigByEntity()` was removed

#### docker-compose: add rabbitMQ and php-consumer containers for review stage on gitlab CI [#2953](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/2953)

-   if you are using GitlabCI, add rabbitMQ container to the GitlabCI server `docker-compose.yml` configuration file (you find it on the server in `/home/ci/` directory)
    ```diff
    +   rabbitmq:
    +       image: rabbitmq:3.12-management-alpine
    +       restart: always
    +       depends_on:
    +           - traefik
    +       labels:
    +           - traefik.backend=rabbitmq
    +           - traefik.frontend.rule=Host:rabbitmq.<put-your-ci-domain-here>
    +           - traefik.docker.network=ci_traefik-network
    +           - traefik.port=15672
    +       networks:
    +           - traefik-network
    +           - default
    ```
    -   the docker-compose config should be on the server in `/home/ci/` directory
    -   you must be logged as root (`sudo su`) to be able to make changes in the file
    -   after you save the changes, you need to run `docker-compose up -d` on the server to start the container

#### remove measuring scripts functionality ([#3122](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/3122))

-   if you do not want to remove functionality and are still using it, you should skip migration `Version20240222100000` and keep the functionality
-   you can use GTM for this purpose, see [our docs](docs/integration/third-party-scripts.md) for more information
-   see [project-base-diff](https://github.com/shopsys/project-base/commit/d51d307d75355cc705433b77be84c300e615d02a) to update your project

#### remove unnecessary default value for domain config in zustand ([#2888](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/2888))

-   you probably do not need the default value as well, as we set it right at the beginning of page load
-   see [project-base-diff](https://github.com/shopsys/project-base/commit/bd7f9081b8dea4884b8a64e2e1c9b08d0d0d70ed) to update your project

#### fixed undefined window error ([#2882](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/2882))

-   in one of the previous PR's, the `canUseDom` function was removed, but it caused the application to fail in some cases
-   because of that, the function was brought back as a constant (as `isClient`) and some checks were reinstantiated
-   in your code, you should pay attention to where you are using the window object and make sure it is available (either by checking the logic or by explicitly wrapping it in a check)
-   also keep in mind that `canUseDom` is now `isClient` and `isServer` is now used as `!isClient`
-   see [project-base-diff](https://github.com/shopsys/project-base/commit/04e8db4f742d61c62385ed780365002d4fb40ce5) to update your project

#### add Prettier plugin and ESlint plugins and rules ([#2874](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/2874))

-   to check if your repo follows the new rules run `pnpm run check` or `pnpm run check--fix` to autofix in Storefront folder or in Storefront Docker container
-   **Prettier**
    -   added `@trivago/prettier-plugin-sort-imports` plugin
-   **ESlint**
    -   added `eslint-plugin-no-relative-import-paths` plugin and rules enforcing rules for imports
    -   new rules

#### add instant page skeleton after link click ([#2863](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/2863))

-   before page must first load and then skeleton was shown, now we pass page type to `ExtendedLink` component which allow us to display immediately after user click on the link proper skeleton for the required page
-   some reorganization and renaming was done to Skeletons, we basically have only two types of skeletons, for pages and modules, since it is sometimes difficult to recognise which one is which, we have added Page word, but this was not perfect in folder organization, that's why it's been added word Module as well, to organize skeletons better way
-   added missing skeletons for Homepage and Stores
-   adjustments to current skeletons to match the design of a page better
-   see [project-base-diff](https://github.com/shopsys/project-base/commit/c1748e3bc06a94db97359699dd17f7996cb5a3aa) to update your project

#### refactoring of various error-related matters on SF ([#2871](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/2871))

-   the goal was to shine light on some of the not-well-understood places in regard of error handling on SF
-   for you to get the most out of this PR, you should check `error-handling.md` in SF docs, which is a direct result of this PR
-   it contains explanations and tips on how to improve error handling in your SF code as well
-   see [project-base-diff](https://github.com/shopsys/project-base/commit/c64b280e4c649234a2d6f9d13c446974955e36c1) to update your project

#### refactor `ProductVariantsTable` ([#2899](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/2899))

-   `ProductVariantsTable` component was made with table element but on smaller screens it was styled more like list. This was causing styling difficulties. That's why it has been replaced with grid with combination of flexbox.
-   components `ProductVariantsTableRow` and `Variant` were removed
-   component `ProductVariantsTable` was renamed to `ProductDetailVariantsTable` so it matches parent folder where it's placed
-   see [project-base-diff](https://github.com/shopsys/project-base/commit/ccdd33736910b9193573d2a20a23cf3894616426) to update your project

#### add equal spacing to the Category page ([#2900](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/2900))

-   see [project-base-diff](https://github.com/shopsys/project-base/commit/970d9f186736cdfb4bbe3dd8eba0d032243d95ca) to update your project

#### auth (loading) improvements ([#2897](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/2897))

-   `window.location.href` assignments were replaced with `router` operations because of unexpected behavior, where the current URL (thus also properties of the router) changed even before the transition, which caused useEffects and some other conditions to re-run and potentially fails
-   if you manipulate `window.location` in your code, you should remove it and use `router` instead
-   loading states for all auth operations (login, logout, registration) are now implemented, so if you have some custom states, you should also handle these
-   optimistic display of skeletons was implemented for `logout-loading` and both `registration-loading...`states

    -   this was possible as we know that the user is going to be redirected to homepage
    -   however, since we do not know the page type of the redirect destination after login, we do not display any skeleton there
    -   if you always know the destination of redirect after login, chances are you can improve the UX by implementing the following changes:

    ```tsx
    // inside useAuth.tsx login
    updateAuthLoadingState(
        loginResult.data.Login.showCartMergeInfo ? 'login-loading-with-cart-modifications' : 'login-loading',
    );

    // add this line to start showing the skeleton before the redirect
    updatePageLoadingState({
        isPageLoading: true,
        redirectPageType: 'my-page-type',
    });

    if (rewriteUrl) {
        router.replace(rewriteUrl).then(() => router.reload());
    } else {
        router.reload();
    }
    ```

#### remove `Heading` component ([#2894](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/2894))

-   it was decided by FE team that this component is not beneficial
-   it was replaced with general H tags and styles were put into globals.css, styles were also included with new classes (`h1`, `h2`, `h3`, `h4`) which we can use to style text which suppose to look like heading but it is not important enough for mark with H tag
-   also from those headings and heading classes was remove margin bottom since spacing should be set in exact place where this component is used, not everywhere
-   see [project-base-diff](https://github.com/shopsys/project-base/commit/ebfb1b539cea4679043d6d37f5672d104a79a039) to update your project

#### remove error logging for when gtmSafePush is called outside of the client ([#2920](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/2920))

-   logging this type of error brought no business value, thus it was removed
-   if you want to treat this ignorable event in a more strict way, you might want to keep the logging, but then you have to improve its behavior yourself
-   see [project-base-diff](https://github.com/shopsys/project-base/commit/ef5055be77da1eea993acd6bbc2b378cf6b9e4fc) to update your project

#### added logic for ordering GTM events ([#2921](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/2921))

-   added a GTM context provider for synchronizing events
-   if you have any logic for syncing your events, you can move it to this provider
-   docs were added, so you can base your changes on those
-   see [project-base-diff](https://github.com/shopsys/project-base/commit/37499c954ae18b1de6831091682f61b0dfa49f9b) to update your project

#### improve SEO categories logic in regards to non-SEO-sensitive filters ([#2891](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/2891))

-   we moved some config from various files to `config/constants` and warmly suggest you do the same, as it improves the app and testing
-   we also moved some hooks from `helpers` to `hooks` and suggest you do the same with all hooks, as it again improves the app and testing
-   the implemented functionality for dynamic switching between SEO-sensitivity for various filters is only implemented on SF, so applying these changes won't make it work on BE
-   if you do not need SEO categories, these changes might be irrelevant altogether
-   flag and brand values are now merged after change of default parameters (leaving SEO category) instead of overwritting. This is a bug fix and you should apply it to your changes as well.
-   see [project-base-diff](https://github.com/shopsys/project-base/commit/90a8bd7904121ec85f02b0b701cda629b99a2015) to update your project

#### category data fetching logic improvements ([#2893](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/2893))

-   these changes primarily focus on fixing loading and fetching logic on the category page
-   there were certain bugs with double loads, skeleton glitches, etc. but they were mostly caused by the added complexity of SEO categories, so if you do not have those and your fetching logic is thus much simpler, you probably do not need most of these changes
-   the category detail fetching was also rewritten to the generated URQL hook, which can be beneficial for you if your logic allows you to do so
-   one thing that you should definitely consider is removal of `onRouteChangeError` from the page loading logic, as the previous implementation was rather invalid. See commit message for more details

#### added additional skeletons, sync store across browser tabs, use BroadcastChannel to refresh cart after Add/Remove to/from cart, ExtendedNextLink was refactored, remove EmptyCartWrapper ([#2906](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/2906))

-   added skeletons for Wishlist, Comparison and My orders, Order detail and Product Main Variant page
-   fix Add to cart/wishlist/comparison feature when using multiple tabs

    -   Before this change if I open multiple tabs as fresh unlogged user without `cartUuid`, then in each tab I add product to cart, I am experiencing that each tab contains different products in cart, even after refresh. Same applies to `Wishlist` and `Comparison`. This is solved now by adding `BroadcastChannel` middleware to Zustand store, so now it uses always only first returned `uuid`.
    -   removed redirect to homepage after logout, this was not good approach
    -   `removeItemFromCartAction ` in `useRemoveProductFromCart` is now `void` type (doesn't return `CartFragmentApi`) and in case of error is returned from API it refect cart so user gets latest cart updates
    -   Zustand package is upgraded to latest version
    -   We are now manually hydrating the Zustand store during the initial page load. This means that we no longer need to resolve mismatches between the UI rendered by the server and the UI managed on the client side. Code from this example may look familiar to you, this is no longer needed:

    ```tsx
    const [isFetchingPaused, setIsFetchingPaused] = useState(true);

    const [{ data: comparisonData, fetching }] = useComparisonQueryApi({
        variables: { comparisonUuid },
        pause: isFetchingPaused,
        pause: !comparisonUuid && !isUserLoggedIn,
    });

    useEffect(() => {
        setIsFetchingPaused(!comparisonUuid && !isUserLoggedIn);
    }, [comparisonUuid]);
    ```

-   fix Add to cart/wishlist/comparison feature when using multiple tabs
    -   As fresh unlogged user without `cartUuid` I open multiple tabs, then in each tab I add product to cart, I am experiencing that each tab contains different products in cart, even after refresh. Same applies to `Wishlist` and `Comparison`. This was solved by adding `BroadcastChannel` middleware to Zustand store, so now it uses always only first returned `uuid`.
    -   Added useBroadcastChannel hook, this allow us to use Broadcast Channel for better handling multitab behavior. Together with the first type Auth for handling Authentication. Now when user log in/out, other tabs are reloaded.
-   ExtendedNextLink was refactored
    -   remove static type from your links
    -   if you have custom types, we moved it from STATIC_PAGES to CUSTOM_PAGES
-   use BroadcastChannel to refresh cart
    -   whereever you use modifications for cart there should be also implemented the same behavior
    -   Removed isCartEmpty value from useCurrentCart. This was causing unnecessary checks for cart value after check if isCartEmpty, because Typescript was not able to recognise that cart value is already checked. For the same reason some handling cases were more difficult to write and understand. Also check for cart exist (!cartUuid && !isUserLoggedIn) was needed basically everywhere where cart values were using, this was added to this hook and now cart value is consistent
-   remove EmptyCartWrapper
    -   this component was making whole order process very difficult to predict behavior, now we have the logic from this component splitted into each page of the order process which makes it much more predictable
    -   also this fixes bug with infinite cart page loading

#### improve repeat order related mutations ([#2876](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/2876))

-   the maximum number of payment transaction is set to 2 (using `MAX_ALLOWED_PAYMENT_TRANSACTIONS`), this means that the user can repeat payment only once, so if this does not match your requirements, you need to change it
-   GoPay SWIFT selection was moved directly inside payment selection, which might not be visible right away if you use the same approach as we do (hide unselected transports and payments), however if you do not do that, this new layout might be suitable for you
-   RegistrationAfterOrder now takes care of its own conditional rendering, so if you want to add a condition, move it inside the component
-   PaymentConfirmationElements and PaymentConfirmationContent were removed and instead a new ConfirmationPageContent is used, which is common for all confirmation pages. If this does not suit your needs (e.g. the page needs to look completely different in each case), you probably want to either modify the new component or use multiple different ones.
-   logic for PaymentFail and PaymentSuccess was reduced and is now either inside the usePaymentConfirmationContent hook, which is responsible for fetching the content from the API, or inside ConfirmationPageContent, which is responsible for structuring the content. If you do not want to load the page content from API, these changes might not be necessary for you, and you can simplify the logic by having static components, instead of dynamic ones.
-   two new queries for payment confirmation were added on SF. If you have previously implemented the logic for order confirmation page dynamic content, you can follow that example and implement it similarly.
-   query for order confirmation was renamed (the word 'Query' was added)
-   expiration of confirmation content is now taken into account on SF by ignoring the API error and not rendering the content. This was a bug (missing feature) in previous versions. If you have not fixed it yourself before, you definitely want to implement these changes, because otherwise, the user can see errors when displaying the order confirmation page after a certain timeout.
-   query parameters parsed using getStringFromUrlQuery are now also trimmed, which makes sure the API can understand the string. For example, the API does not understand " 440ecde4-b992-4290-8636-4f454c9cf475 " as a valid UUID.

#### display Transport and Payment description on desktop ([#2930](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/2930))

-   see [project-base-diff](https://github.com/shopsys/project-base/commit/156591dd8a38f267c27c018e5b1c3fb86bc95e11) to update your project

#### implemented generic product lists ([#2901](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/2901))

-   previous implementation for wishlist and comparison was removed, so if you want to keep them, you have to re-implement it according to the new requirements (use of generic API queries and mutations)
-   this opens door for multiple lists of any kind, so if you want multiple wishlists or other types of lists, you can do that, just don't forget to

    -   use the generic queries, mutations, and fragments (`AddProductToListMutation`, `RemoveProductFromListMutation`, `RemoveProductListMutation`, `ProductListQuery`, `ProductListFragment`, and `ProductInProductListFragment`)

    -   create a wrapper hook (such as `useWishlist`) which uses `useProductList` and provides the product list type and necessary callbacks

-   keep in mind that the implementation heavily depends on the graphcache in `cacheExchange.ts`. This cache is responsible for manually updating queries, which decreases the number of requests, but also makes the entire functionality to behave as expected. If you use the generic mutations, queries, and fragments, you do not need to touch it, as it should work out of the box. However, there is a chance that your implementation will be more customized and not directly follow the provided one, for example by having a custom query for your list. In such case, if implementing any other list in a more custom manner, follow the guidelines in the docs (`graphcache.md`).
-   we also renamed `productsCompare` to `comparedProducts` across the files as it is a more suitable and better name.
-   see [project-base-diff](https://github.com/shopsys/project-base/commit/bf6a4130348660b41b509a8a182e752d24fb4222) to update your project

#### package.json fix to minors ([#2923](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/2923))

-   all SF packages were updated to the highest possible patch within the current minor version
-   see [project-base-diff](https://github.com/shopsys/project-base/commit/63f9d4dd0bf4b68636e9ca3720d300f81e9a00d1) to update your project

#### implement NextImage component ([#2924](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/2924))

-   Now we don't use `srcset` solution anymore for which was our `Image` component prepared. It was replaced with the solution provided by Next.js which is `NextImage` component. This component allows us many more possibilities. But it comes with a price. Since `NextImage` is capable of different image rendering methods we need to adjust each image to the chosen method. For this there is no specific advice, but we have 2 methods:

    -   Each `Image` has specific dimensions `width` and `height`, here we need to usually adjust `w-auto` or `max-h-full` so it is displayed properly. All depends on project and specific place.
    -   `Image` component has `fill` prop, no need to specify `width` or `height` props. But it needs some wrapper which has specified dimensions to limit the image. Then you can use different `object-fit` CSS properties.
    -   check all places where you use the `Image` component and modify them accordingly as the component interface has changed
    -   in your `next.config.js`, add all your domains names into `images -> remotePatterns` setting

#### add categoryHierarchy to Category query ([#2962](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/2962))

-   in order to have a proper category tree for GTM (and Luigi's Box) we need to add proper category hierarchy tree, now we send whole tree instead of last category id

#### customer's user cart is now overwritten with the incoming cart if logged in in 3rd order step ([#2978](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/2978))

-   new optional parameter `shouldOverwriteCustomerUserCart` was added to `LoginMutation`
-   you can use it if in certain scenarios it makes more sense to overwrite customer user's cart instead of merging it
-   see [project-base-diff](https://github.com/shopsys/project-base/commit/104f3c6d2bb7dd740614a80e7840d22cdd1b6eaf) to update your project

#### fix image sizes ([#2968](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/2968))

-   after migration to Next Image component there were some places left to adjust proper image sizes
-   Fix additionally downloaded image is loaded after product page render. `Lightgallery` is not cooperating right with `NextImage` component. It doesn't know about which image (`width`) was loaded from `srcset` so it takes src from image loaded with `NextImage` which is full size of 3840px and loads it immediately after page loads in order to having it downloaded after user opens an image modal. After the image modal opens `LightGallery` loads original image (which is without `width` query) anyway. So preloaded image is loaded for nothing. Proper fix is replacing `Lightgallery` with new component for Image Modal Gallery.
-   Remove `image-rendering:-webkit-optimize-contrast` from images. This property is causing some of images to be rendered with sharp edges on places where it is not wanted. Browsers algorithms seem to handle this value correctly on its own without need to use specific rendering property.

    ```tsx
    const HomePage: FC<ServerSidePropsType> = ({ cookies }) => {
    ```
-   include tag <LastVisitedProducts lastVisitedProductsFromCookies={cookies.lastVisitedProducts} /> on place where you want to display last visited products
-   default places: homepage, product detail, search, category, blog list, blog detail

#### add possibility to change SF error verbosity for development ([#2990](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/2990))

-   added possibility for controlling error verbosity on SF (can be now devel or user) which can be set independently of the actual node environment. This allows for better error debugging on SF
-   errorDebugging controls the verbosity of errors on SF, it is controlled by an environment variable
-   `error-handling.md` was extended with the new information and can be used to update your project

#### replace Lightgallery with custom ModalGallery component ([#2995](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/2995))

-   new features:
    -   custom useKeyPress hook, responsible for handling key press events
    -   new library for handling swiping events (react-swipeable)
    -   gallery is loaded dynamically, allowing us to lower the size of product page

#### add swipe handlers to our custom product slider ([#2996](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/2996))

-   after replacing `Lightgallery` with a custom solution we have the `react-swipeable` library available, which provides us with a hook to handle swipe events, this is another place where we want to use it
-   see [project-base-diff](https://github.com/shopsys/project-base/commit/01ac4a0694e62ecb0407ec357569f628e1402cf1) to update your project

#### update repo dependencies ([#3010](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/3010))

-   after this we use latest major versions for the most of our dependencies
-   with this change we get rid of 4 critical `pnpm audit` issues
-   see [project-base-diff](https://github.com/shopsys/project-base/commit/7da8f679e461197f56a7247fa9cc5583fa089f32) to update your project

#### added hreflang links to Head ([#3005](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/3005))

-   see [project-base-diff](https://github.com/shopsys/project-base/commit/8f095e86091f075949697eb2fe24311da0843f09) to update your project

-   see [project-base-diff](https://github.com/shopsys/project-base/commit/f613cd20d555863246ca7036d70cee401cb57037) to update your project

#### improvements to Storefront typings ([#3009](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/3009))

-   certain broadcast channel events are now not processed in the same tab, this is controlled by the code below from `useBroadcastChannel.ts`:

```ts
const broadcastChannelSameTabConfig: Record<BroadcastChannelsType, boolean> = {
    refetchCart: false,
    reloadPage: true,
};
```

-   types in cache exchange were improved/fixed and the documentation and cookbooks in `graphcache.md` were updated accordingly, check your types in cache exchange and change them to match the new types
-   `initServerSideProps` now accepts type arguments for provided variables for prefetched queries, which can be used to make sure that you provide correct variables

```ts
return initServerSideProps<OrderDetailByHashQueryVariablesApi>({
    context,
    prefetchedQueries: [{ query: OrderDetailByHashQueryDocumentApi, variables: { urlHash: context.params.urlHash } }],
    redisClient,
    domainConfig,
    t,
});
```

-   static rewrite paths are now not accessed through the Next.js config based on a JS file, but instead a TS file is provided, which can be accessed directly and includes literal type values
    -   the keys for the static rewrite paths object must be defined based on 2 sources (`process.env` or `publicRuntimeConfig`), because one of them is not accessible on the client (`process.env`) and the other one is not accessible in `middleware.ts` (`publicRuntimeConfig`)

#### added more verbose error messages when using logException on SF ([#3018](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/3018))

-   messages logged to sentry now contain more context
-   when adding error logs using `logException`, make sure you always provide as much context as possible
-   see [project-base-diff](https://github.com/shopsys/project-base/commit/c5aa1632797b416aae17e209fc5546b222048515) to update your project

#### add display timezone to FE API SettingsQuery ([#2977](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/2977))

-   timezone is now taken from API (part of SettingsQuery)
-   timezone application was kept in `useFormatDate`
-   SF falls back to the timezone set in NextJS config if API is unavailable
-   NextJS config timezone was renamed from `timezone` to `fallbackTimezone`

#### fixed non-working sentry logging on SF ([#3034]https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/3034)

-   change any call to `logException` to only pass one argument, which should be a complete error with all of its context
-   see [project-base-diff](https://github.com/shopsys/project-base/commit/60643d3de0516dc08adf3b7a3664c3472c99b9a0) to update your project

#### refactored cypress tests ([#3023](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/3023))

-   rewrote cypress tests to typescript for better static control and easier working with the code, so in you should do the same with your cypress files
    -   make sure to change the file extensions and add type annotiations
    -   make sure to include any extra files in your `tsconfig.json`
-   changed the structure of the `cypress` folder
    -   make sure to follow the new folder structure (you can find out how in the docs - `cypress.md`)
-   simplified accessing DOM elements in cypress by introducing a new cypress command `getByTID`, so you should use this method to access elements in order to do it in a unified way
-   introduced visual snapshot testing using the cypress-visual-regression library
    -   if you want to do any visual testing, you can inspire yourself in e.g. order tests (`createOrder.cy.ts`)
-   introduced the possibility to do real UI interactions using the cypress-real-events library
    -   if you want to simulate any "real" UI interactions, such as hover, focus, etc. you can use this library
-   introduced custom cypress commands to work with cart, which is helpful when cart needs to be modified before a test
    -   if you need to modify cart directly via API, you should use/extend these methods
-   tests are now grouped in related test suites using the `describe` test suit group
    -   you should do the same for any future tests, read the docs if unsure
-   test names now use the 'should do something' convention, which you should also follow in your tests
-   refactored data test IDs
    -   they were removed from all the unused places, so you should also remove them from any such places in your code
    -   test IDs are not string literals anymore but an enum instead, so you should follow this example and add all the values which you are using in your tests
    -   they were renamed to `tid` everywhere, so you should do the same
-   as the docker setup for running acceptance tests was improved, makefile commands (`run-acceptance-tests-base` and `run-acceptance-tests-actual`) should be used to run tests
-   add `closeOnClick` to all toast messages, as even though this should not be necessary (it is the default option), it does not work without it
-   see [project-base-diff](https://github.com/shopsys/project-base/commit/36aa5cfd3c970906b501a717844cf82695e55419) to update your project

#### add new argument to enable personalized search and refactor stores ([#3044](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/3044))

-   additional `userId` argument is added to search queries that is used for `Luigi's box`, this unique `userIdentifier` is generated and saved in persisted store
-   `useStoreHydration` is renamed to `usePersistStoreHydration`
-   product image during navigation (back in history between products) was not changing, this was fixed by adding `key` prop to gallery component
-   in order to improve cookies handling we have refactored this logic for setting cookies
    -   now we use `CookieStore` to store values for cookies in `Zustand` and then whole store is being synchronized to cookies
    -   during app initialization cookies are set to `CookieStore`
    -   `LastVisitedProduct` is also refactored for use `CookiesStore` instead of using and handling cookies directly
    -   `createUserConsentSlice` is removed and `userConsent` data is part of `createUserSlice`
    -   we have discovered issue with Zustand store session during SSR, when setting values on server session was not destroyed and was used also for next session, this was solved by moving `CookiesStore` to `Context`, as it is the recommended way to handle such cases
-   domainConfig is moved from `SessionStore` to `Context` for easier handling and solve issue with SSR session (see previous comment from cookies refactoring)

#### Luigi's Box recommended products ([#3099](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/3099))

-   all portal-diplsyaed are now displayed by setting it as content in zustand's portal state slice
-   we do not use `createPortal` anymore, as it was causing issues with appending children instead of replacing and also with React errors while navigating from a page
-   instead of having a local state and modifying some variable based on which a popup is displayed, use `updatePortalContent(<DisplayedComponent />)` to show and `updatePortalContent(null)` to hide the desired content
-   `useErrorPopupVisibility` was renamed to `useErrorPopup`which now does not return anything but handles popup displaying
-   cookie store is now initialized on the server and then synced on the client, which was necessary to have a value (`userIdentifier`) available immediately and then synced in all subsequent loads
-   all popup components should be moved inside `components/Blocks/Popup`
