For your code to be accepted, you should follow our guidelines mentioned above,
and the code must pass [coding standards](https://docs.shopsys.com/en/latest/contributing/coding-standards/) checks and tests:
```
php phing standards tests tests-acceptance
```

Your code may not infringe the copyrights of any third party.
If you are changing a composer's dependency in composer.json or you are changing the npm dependencies in package.json, you need to reflect this change into a list of [Open Source License Acknowledgements and Third Party Copyrights](./open-source-license-acknowledgements-and-third-party-copyrights.md).
Apply the same procedure if you make the changes in Dockerfile or docker-compose.yml files.

These rules ensure that the code will remain consistent and the project is maintainable in the future.

*Tip: Read more about automatic checks in [Console Commands for Application Management (Phing Targets)](https://docs.shopsys.com/en/latest/introduction/console-commands-for-application-management-phing-targets/) and [Running Acceptance Tests](https://docs.shopsys.com/en/latest/introduction/running-acceptance-tests/).*
