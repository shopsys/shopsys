Update the current development session by:

1. Check if `.claude/sessions/.current-session` exists to find the active session
2. If no active session, inform user to start one with `/project:session-start`
3. If session exists, append to the session file with:
    - Current timestamp
    - The update: $ARGUMENTS (or if no arguments, summarize recent activities)
    - Git status summary:
        * Files added/modified/deleted (from `git status --porcelain`)
        * Current branch and last commit
    - Todo list status:
        * Number of completed/in-progress/pending tasks
        * List any newly completed tasks
    - Any issues encountered
    - Solutions implemented
    - Code changes made

Keep updates concise but comprehensive for future reference.
