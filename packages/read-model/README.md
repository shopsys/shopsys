This bundle for [Shopsys Framework](https://www.shopsys.com) separates templates from model using [read model concept](https://docs.shopsys.com/en/8.0/model/introduction-to-read-model/).
The bundle is dedicated for projects based on Shopsys Framework (i.e. created from [`shopsys/project-base`](https://github.com/shopsys/project-base)) exclusively.

This repository is maintained by [shopsys/shopsys] monorepo, information about changes is in [monorepo CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

## Installation
The plugin is a Symfony bundle and is installed in the same way:

### Download
First, you download the package using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/):
```
composer require shopsys/read-model
```

### Register
For the bundle to be loaded in your application you need to register it in `registerBundles()` method in the `app/AppKernel.php` file of your project:
```diff
+ new Shopsys\ReadModelBundle\ShopsysReadModelBundle(),
```

## Usage
If you want to leverage the advantages of read model concept, you need to use the particular implementation of `ListedProductViewFacadeInterface` in your controllers (there is already prepared one implementation in the bundle).
The facade provides you the view objects for product lists that can be then used in the templates.

### Available View Objects
- [`ListedProductView`](src/Product/Listed/ListedProductView.php) - product representation for FE product lists
- [`ActionView`](src/Product/Action/ProductActionView.php) - representation of product action area (i.e. form for adding a product to cart, or link to the product detail in the case of main variant)
- [`ImageView`](src/Image/ImageView.php) - representation of image

### Available Twig functions
- `image` - renders image from given `ImageView`
