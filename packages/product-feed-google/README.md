```

### Register
For the bundle to be loaded in your application you need to register it in the `app/AppKernel.php` file of your project:
```php
// ...
class AppKernel extends Kernel
{
    public function registerBundles()
    {
        $bundles = [
            // ...
            new Shopsys\ProductFeed\GoogleBundle\ShopsysProductFeedGoogleBundle(),
            // ...
        ];

        // ...

        return $bundles;
    }

    // ...
}
```

## How to use
You should see the new feed immediately after installation in the administration feed list.
All output XML files will be automatically generated by a cron module or they can be generated manually in administration when logged as superadmin.
