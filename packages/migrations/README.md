This bundle provides commands which can be useful for database migrations:
* `shopsys:migrations:check-mapping` checks if ORM mapping is valid.
* `shopsys:migrations:check-schema` checks if database schema is satisfying ORM.
* `shopsys:migrations:count` returns count of migrations to execute.
* `shopsys:migrations:migrate` executes all database migrations in one transaction.
    * the command supports installing migrations from multiple sources, so every bundle can have its own migrations
    * it creates a `migration-lock.yml` file in the project's root, persisting the order of execution
    * migrations can be manually reordered or skipped if necessary
* `shopsys:migrations:generate` generates database migrations if the schema was changed
    * the command does not generate migrations that break backwards compatibility - eg. column dropping
    * prompts you to choose the location for migration file if you are developing more than one bundle

This bundle uses [DoctrineMigrationsBundle](https://symfony.com/doc/current/bundles/DoctrineMigrationsBundle), so you have to install both.

This repository is maintained by [shopsys/shopsys] monorepo, information about changes are in [monorepo CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

## To be able to use this bundle, you need to do following:
1. Require `shopsys/migrations` in `composer.json`
2. Register bundles in your `AppKernel.php`:

    ```
    new Doctrine\Bundle\MigrationsBundle\DoctrineMigrationsBundle(),
    new Shopsys\MigrationBundle\ShopsysMigrationBundle(),
    ```
3. Configure `DoctrineMigrationsBundle` according to its documentation (see https://symfony.com/doc/current/bundles/DoctrineMigrationsBundle/index.html#configuration)
