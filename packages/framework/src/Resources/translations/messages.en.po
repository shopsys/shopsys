We don't have to think about it as label, it is mainly headline or important part for the whole small form block. But most of the times it is label. Another 2 elements serve to align the content part. It is <strong class=\"in-article__visible\">form-line__side</strong> and <strong class=\"in-article__visible\">form-line__line</strong>. They are placed after label and the first one aligns content next to the label and never gets under the label. The second one takes the whole width under label. The most important is <strong class=\"in-article__visible\">form-line__item</strong> which is wrap for anything in the content area. We need the wrap because elements should always be intent and aligned correctly. Only now we can put inputs, texts, icons etc. into these elements.
